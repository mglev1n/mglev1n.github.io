	abstract = {Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) represent two forms of clonal hematopoiesis where clones bearing expanded somatic mutations have been linked to both oncologic and non-oncologic clinical outcomes including atherosclerosis and all-cause mortality. Epidemiologic studies have highlighted smoking as an important driver of somatic mutations across multiple tissues. However, establishing the causal role of smoking in clonal hematopoiesis has been limited by observational study designs, which may suffer from confounding and reverse-causality. We performed two complementary analyses to investigate the role of smoking in mCAs and CHIP. First, using an observational study design among UK Biobank participants, we confirmed strong associations between smoking and mCAs. Second, using two-sample Mendelian randomization, smoking was strongly associated with mCA but not with CHIP. Overall, these results support a causal association between smoking and mCAs and suggest smoking may variably shape the fitness of clones bearing somatic mutations.},

	abstract = {Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) are circulating reservoirs of fatty acids used as vital energy sources for peripheral tissues. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a predominant enzyme mediating triglyceride (TG) lipolysis and TRL clearance to provide fatty acids to tissues in animals. Physiological and human genetic evidence support a primary role for LPL in hydrolyzing TRL TGs. We hypothesized that endothelial lipase (EL), another extracellular lipase that primarily hydrolyzes lipoprotein phospholipids may also contribute to TRL metabolism. To explore this, we studied the impact of genetic EL loss-of-function on TRL metabolism in humans and mice. Humans carrying a loss-of-function missense variant in LIPG, p.Asn396Ser (rs77960347), demonstrated elevated plasma TGs and elevated phospholipids in TRLs, among other lipoprotein classes. Mice with germline EL deficiency challenged with excess dietary TG through refeeding or a high-fat diet exhibited elevated TGs, delayed dietary TRL clearance, and impaired TRL TG lipolysis in vivo that was rescued by EL reconstitution in the liver. Lipidomic analyses of postprandial plasma from high-fat fed Lipg-/- mice demonstrated accumulation of phospholipids and TGs harboring long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), known substrates for EL lipolysis. In vitro and in vivo, EL and LPL together promoted greater TG lipolysis than either extracellular lipase alone. Our data positions EL as a key collaborator of LPL to mediate efficient lipolysis of TRLs in humans and mice.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lipoprotein-related traits have been consistently identified as risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, largely on the basis of studies of coronary artery disease (CAD). The relative contributions of specific lipoproteins to the risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD) have not been well defined. We leveraged large-scale genetic association data to investigate the effects of circulating lipoprotein-related traits on PAD risk.
METHODS: Genome-wide association study summary statistics for circulating lipoprotein-related traits were used in the mendelian randomization bayesian model averaging framework to prioritize the most likely causal major lipoprotein and subfraction risk factors for PAD and CAD. Mendelian randomization was used to estimate the effect of apolipoprotein B (ApoB) lowering on PAD risk using gene regions proxying lipid-lowering drug targets. Genes relevant to prioritized lipoprotein subfractions were identified with transcriptome-wide association studies.
RESULTS: ApoB was identified as the most likely causal lipoprotein-related risk factor for both PAD (marginal inclusion probability, 0.86; P=0.003) and CAD (marginal inclusion probability, 0.92; P=0.005). Genetic proxies for ApoB-lowering medications were associated with reduced risk of both PAD (odds ratio,0.87 per 1-SD decrease in ApoB [95\% CI, 0.84-0.91]; P=9×10-10) and CAD (odds ratio,0.66 [95\% CI, 0.63-0.69]; P=4×10-73), with a stronger predicted effect of ApoB lowering on CAD (ratio of effects, 3.09 [95\% CI, 2.29-4.60]; P{\textless}1×10-6). Extra-small very-low-density lipoprotein particle concentration was identified as the most likely subfraction associated with PAD risk (marginal inclusion probability, 0.91; P=2.3×10-4), whereas large low-density lipoprotein particle concentration was the most likely subfraction associated with CAD risk (marginal inclusion probability, 0.95; P=0.011). Genes associated with extra-small very-low-density lipoprotein particle and large low-density lipoprotein particle concentration included canonical ApoB pathway components, although gene-specific effects were variable. Lipoprotein(a) was associated with increased risk of PAD independently of ApoB (odds ratio, 1.04 [95\% CI, 1.03-1.04]; P=1.0×10-33).
CONCLUSIONS: ApoB was prioritized as the major lipoprotein fraction causally responsible for both PAD and CAD risk. However, ApoB-lowering drug targets and ApoB-containing lipoprotein subfractions had diverse associations with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and distinct subfraction-associated genes suggest possible differences in the role of lipoproteins in the pathogenesis of PAD and CAD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an important cause of cardiovascular mortality; however, its genetic determinants remain incompletely defined. In total, 10 previously identified risk loci explain a small fraction of AAA heritability.
METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study in the Million Veteran Program testing ≈18 million DNA sequence variants with AAA (7642 cases and 172 172 controls) in veterans of European ancestry with independent replication in up to 4972 cases and 99 858 controls. We then used mendelian randomization to examine the causal effects of blood pressure on AAA. We examined the association of AAA risk variants with aneurysms in the lower extremity, cerebral, and iliac arterial beds, and derived a genome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) to identify a subset of the population at greater risk for disease.
RESULTS: Through a genome-wide association study, we identified 14 novel loci, bringing the total number of known significant AAA loci to 24. In our mendelian randomization analysis, we demonstrate that a genetic increase of 10 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.43 [95\% CI, 1.24-1.66]; P=1.6×10-6), as opposed to systolic blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.06 [95\% CI, 0.97-1.15]; P=0.2), likely has a causal relationship with AAA development. We observed that 19 of 24 AAA risk variants associate with aneurysms in at least 1 other vascular territory. A 29-variant PRS was strongly associated with AAA (odds ratioPRS, 1.26 [95\% CI, 1.18-1.36]; PPRS=2.7×10-11 per SD increase in PRS), independent of family history and smoking risk factors (odds ratioPRS+family history+smoking, 1.24 [95\% CI, 1.14-1.35]; PPRS=1.27×10-6). Using this PRS, we identified a subset of the population with AAA prevalence greater than that observed in screening trials informing current guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: We identify novel AAA genetic associations with therapeutic implications and identify a subset of the population at significantly increased genetic risk of AAA independent of family history. Our data suggest that extending current screening guidelines to include testing to identify those with high polygenic AAA risk, once the cost of genotyping becomes comparable with that of screening ultrasound, would significantly increase the yield of current screening at reasonable cost.},

	abstract = {Observational studies have shown an association between hypertension and atrial fibrillation (AF). Aggressive blood pressure management in patients with known AF reduces overall arrhythmia burden, but it remains unclear whether hypertension is causative for AF. To address this question, this study explored the relationship between genetic predictors of blood pressure and risk of AF. We secondarily explored the relationship between genetically proxied use of antihypertensive drugs and risk of AF. Two-sample Mendelian randomization was performed using an inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis with weighted median Mendelian randomization and Egger intercept tests performed as sensitivity analyses. Summary statistics for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure were obtained from the International Consortium of Blood Pressure and the UK Biobank discovery analysis and AF from the 2018 Atrial Fibrillation Genetics Consortium multiethnic genome-wide association studies. Increases in genetically proxied systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or pulse pressure by 10 mm Hg were associated with increased odds of AF (systolic blood pressure: odds ratio [OR], 1.17 [95\% CI, 1.11–1.22];

	abstract = {Clinical observations have linked tobacco smoking with increased type 2 diabetes risk. Mendelian randomization analysis has recently suggested smoking may be a causal risk factor for type 2 diabetes. However, this association could be mediated by additional risk factors correlated with smoking behavior, which have not been investigated. We hypothesized that body mass index (BMI) could help to explain the association between smoking and diabetes risk. First, we confirmed that genetic determinants of smoking initiation increased risk for type 2 diabetes (OR 1.21, 95\% CI: 1.15–1.27, P = 1 × 10−12) and coronary artery disease (CAD; OR 1.21, 95\% CI: 1.16–1.26, P = 2 × 10−20). Additionally, 2-fold increased smoking risk was positively associated with increased BMI ({\textasciitilde}0.8 kg/m2, 95\% CI: 0.54–0.98 kg/m2, P = 1.8 × 10−11). Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses showed that BMI accounted for nearly all the risk smoking exerted on type 2 diabetes (OR 1.06, 95\% CI: 1.01–1.11, P = 0.03). In contrast, the independent effect of smoking on increased CAD risk persisted (OR 1.12, 95\% CI: 1.08–1.17, P = 3 × 10−8). Causal mediation analyses agreed with these estimates. Furthermore, analysis using individual-level data from the Million Veteran Program independently replicated the association of smoking behavior with CAD (OR 1.24, 95\% CI: 1.12–1.37, P = 2 × 10−5), but not type 2 diabetes (OR 0.98, 95\% CI: 0.89–1.08, P = 0.69), after controlling for BMI. Our findings support a model whereby genetic determinants of smoking increase type 2 diabetes risk indirectly through their relationship with obesity. Smokers should be advised to stop smoking to limit type 2 diabetes and CAD risk. Therapeutic efforts should consider pathophysiology relating smoking and obesity.},

This locus contains only one annotated gene, tribbles homolog 1 (TRIB1), which has not previously been implicated in lipoprotein metabolism. Here we demonstrate a role for Trib1 as a regulator of lipoprotein metabolism in mice. Hepatic-specific overexpression of Trib1 reduced levels of plasma TG and cholesterol by reducing VLDL production; conversely, Trib1-knockout mice showed elevated levels of plasma TG and cholesterol due to increased VLDL production. Hepatic Trib1 expression was inversely associated with the expression of key lipogenic genes and measures of lipogenesis. Thus, we provide functional evidence for what we believe to be a novel gene regulating hepatic lipogenesis and VLDL production in mice that influences plasma lipids and risk for myocardial infarction in humans.},

To study ischemic stroke in vivo, mice were subjected to sustained ischemia by intraluminal filament-induced middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) for 24 h without reperfusion or transient ischemia for 30 min followed by 23.5 h reperfusion, and brain miRNA and mRNA expression changes were quantified by TaqMan OpenArrays and gene (mRNA) expression arrays, respectively. Sustained ischemia resulted in 18 significantly altered miRNAs and 392 altered mRNAs in mouse brains compared to Sham controls; however, the transient ischemic condition was found to impact only 6 miRNAs and 126 mRNAs. miR-367-3p was found to be significantly decreased in brain homogenates with sustained ischemia. G protein-coupled receptor, family C, group 5, member A (Gprc5a), a miR-367-3p target gene, was found to be significantly increased with sustained ischemia. In primary neurons, inhibition of endogenous miR-367-3p resulted in a significant increase in Gprc5a expression. Moreover, miR-367-3p was found to be co-expressed with GPRC5A in human neurons. Results suggest that loss of miR-367-3p suppression of GPRC5A may contribute to neuroinflammation associated with ischemic stroke.},

	abstract = {Cellular and plasma lipid levels are tightly controlled by complex gene regulatory mechanisms. Elevated plasma lipid content, or hyperlipidemia, is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression and have emerged as important modulators of lipid homeostasis, but the extent of their role has not been systematically investigated. In this study we performed high-throughput small RNA sequencing and detected ≈150 miRNAs in mouse liver. We then employed an unbiased, in silico strategy to identify miRNA regulatory hubs in lipid metabolism, and miR-27b was identified as the strongest such hub in human and mouse liver. In addition, hepatic miR-27b levels were determined to be sensitive to plasma hyperlipidemia, as evidenced by its ≈3-fold up-regulation in the liver of mice on a high-fat diet (42\% calories from fat). Further, we showed in a human hepatocyte cell line (Huh7) that miR-27b regulates the expression (messenger RNA [mRNA] and protein) of several key lipid-metabolism genes, including Angptl3 and Gpam. Finally, we demonstrated that hepatic miR-27b and its target genes are inversely altered in a mouse model of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Conclusion: miR-27b is responsive to lipid levels and controls multiple genes critical to dyslipidemia. © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.},

Here, we demonstrate that microRNA-223 (miR-223), an miRNA previously associated with inflammation, also controls multiple mechanisms associated with cholesterol metabolism. miR-223 promoter activity and mature levels were found to be linked to cellular cholesterol states in hepatoma cells. Moreover, hypercholesterolemia was associated with increased hepatic miR-223 levels in athero-prone mice. miR-223 was found to regulate high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) uptake, through direct targeting and repression of scavenger receptor BI, and to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis through the direct repression of sterol enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1 and methylsterol monooxygenase 1 in humans. Additionally, miR-223 was found to indirectly promote ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 expression (mRNA and protein) through Sp3, thereby enhancing cellular cholesterol efflux. Finally, genetic ablation of miR-223 in mice resulted in increased HDL-C levels and particle size, as well as increased hepatic and plasma total cholesterol levels. In summary, we identified a critical role for miR-223 in systemic cholesterol regulation by coordinated posttranscriptional control of multiple genes in lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism.},

	abstract = {Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) is a circulating inhibitor of lipoprotein and endothelial lipase whose physiological function has remained obscure. Here we show that ANGPTL3 plays a major role in promoting uptake of circulating very low density lipoprotein-triglycerides (VLDL-TGs) into white adipose tissue (WAT) rather than oxidative tissues (skeletal muscle, heart brown adipose tissue) in the fed state. This conclusion emerged from studies of Angptl3-/- mice. Whereas feeding increased VLDL-TG uptake into WAT eightfold in wild-type mice, no increase occurred in fed Angptl3-/- animals. Despite the reduction in delivery to and retention of TG inWAT, fat mass was largely preserved by a compensatory increase in de novo lipogenesis in Angptl3-/- mice. Glucose uptake into WAT was increased 10-fold in KO mice, and tracer studies revealed increased conversion of glucose to fatty acids in WAT but not liver. It is likely that the increased uptake of glucose into WAT explains the increased insulin sensitivity associated with inactivation of ANGPTL3. The beneficial effects of ANGPTL3 deficiency on both glucose and lipoprotein metabolism make it an attractive therapeutic target.},

However, a comprehensive genomics-first evaluation of the impact of TTNtvs in different clinical contexts, and the evaluation of modifiers such as genetic ancestry, has not been performed. Methods: We reviewed whole exome sequence data for {\textgreater}71 000 individuals (61 040 from the Geisinger MyCode Community Health Initiative (2007 to present) and 10 273 from the PennMedicine BioBank (2013 to present) to identify anyone with TTNtvs. We further selected individuals with TTNtvs in exons highly expressed in the heart (proportion spliced in [PSI] {\textgreater}0.9). Using linked electronic health records, we evaluated associations of TTNtvs with diagnoses and quantitative echocardiographic measures, including subanalyses for individuals with and without DCM diagnoses. We also reviewed data from the Jackson Heart Study to validate specific analyses for individuals of African ancestry. Results: Identified with a TTNtv in a highly expressed exon (hiPSI) were 1.2\% individuals in PennMedicine BioBank and 0.6\% at Geisinger. The presence of a hiPSI TTNtv was associated with increased odds of DCM in individuals of European ancestry (odds ratio [95\% CI]: 18.7 [9.1-39.4] \{PennMedicine BioBank\} and 10.8 [7.0-16.0] \{Geisinger\}). hiPSI TTNtvs were not associated with DCM in individuals of African ancestry, despite a high DCM prevalence (odds ratio, 1.8 [0.2-13.7]; P=0.57). Among 244 individuals of European ancestry with DCM in PennMedicine BioBank, hiPSI TTNtv carriers had lower left ventricular ejection fraction (β=-12\%, P=3×10-7), and increased left ventricular diameter (β=0.65 cm, P=9×10-3). In the Geisinger cohort, hiPSI TTNtv carriers without a cardiomyopathy diagnosis had more atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 2.4 [1.6-3.6]) and heart failure (odds ratio, 3.8 [2.4-6.0]), and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (β=-3.4\%, P=1×10-7). Conclusions: Individuals of European ancestry with hiPSI TTNtv have an abnormal cardiac phenotype characterized by lower left ventricular ejection fraction, irrespective of the clinical manifestation of cardiomyopathy. Associations with arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, were observed even when controlling for cardiomyopathy diagnosis. In contrast, no association between hiPSI TTNtvs and DCM was discerned among individuals of African ancestry. Given these findings, clinical identification of hiPSI TTNtv carriers may alter clinical management strategies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is influenced by genetic variation and traditional risk factors. Polygenic risk scores (PRS), which can be ascertained before the development of traditional risk factors, have been shown to identify individuals at elevated risk of CAD. Here, we demonstrate that a genome-wide PRS for CAD predicts all-cause mortality after accounting for not only traditional cardiovascular risk factors but also angiographic CAD itself. METHODS: Individuals who underwent coronary angiography and were enrolled in an institutional biobank were included; those with prior myocardial infarction or heart transplant were excluded. Using a pruning-and-thresholding approach, a genome-wide PRS comprised of 139 239 variants was calculated for 1503 participants who underwent coronary angiography and genotyping. Individuals were categorized into high PRS (hiPRS) and low-PRS control groups using the maximally selected rank statistic. Stratified analysis based on angiographic findings was also performed. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality following the index coronary angiogram. RESULTS: Individuals with hiPRS were younger than controls (66 years versus 69 years; P=2.1×10-5) but did not differ by sex, body mass index, or traditional risk-factor profiles. Individuals with hiPRS were at significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality after cardiac catheterization, adjusting for traditional risk factors and angiographic extent of CAD (hazard ratio, 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.2-2.2; P=0.004). The strongest increase in risk of all-cause mortality conferred by hiPRS was seen among individuals without angiographic CAD (hazard ratio, 2.4; 95\% CI, 1.1-5.5; P=0.04). In the overall cohort, adding hiPRS to traditional risk assessment improved prediction of 5-year all-cause mortality (area under the receiver-operating curve 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.66-0.75 versus 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.61-0.70; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A genome-wide PRS improves risk stratification when added to traditional risk factors and coronary angiography. Individuals without angiographic CAD but with hiPRS remain at significantly elevated risk of mortality.},

Here we develop a multidimensional CRISPR–Cas9 genetic screen, using multiple mitophagy reporter systems and pro-mitophagy triggers, and identify numerous components of parkin-dependent mitophagy1. Unexpectedly, we find that the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) complex is required for mitophagy in several cell types. Whereas pharmacological inhibition of ANT-mediated ADP/ATP exchange promotes mitophagy, genetic ablation of ANT paradoxically suppresses mitophagy. Notably, ANT promotes mitophagy independently of its nucleotide translocase catalytic activity. Instead, the ANT complex is required for inhibition of the presequence translocase TIM23, which leads to stabilization of PINK1, in response to bioenergetic collapse. ANT modulates TIM23 indirectly via interaction with TIM44, which regulates peptide import through TIM232. Mice that lack ANT1 show blunted mitophagy and consequent profound accumulation of aberrant mitochondria. Disease-causing human mutations in ANT1 abrogate binding to TIM44 and TIM23 and inhibit mitophagy. Together, our findings show that ANT is an essential and fundamental mediator of mitophagy in health and disease.},

	abstract = {High-density lipoproteins (HDL) have many biological functions, including reducing endothelial activation and adhesion molecule expression. We recently reported that HDL transport and deliver functional microRNAs (miRNA). Here we show that HDL suppresses expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) through the transfer of miR-223 to endothelial cells. After incubation of endothelial cells with HDL, mature miR-223 levels are significantly increased in endothelial cells and decreased on HDL. However, miR-223 is not transcribed in endothelial cells and is not increased in cells treated with HDL from miR-223 -/- mice. HDL inhibit ICAM-1 protein levels, but not in cells pretreated with miR-223 inhibitors. ICAM-1 is a direct target of HDL-transferred miR-223 and this is the first example of an extracellular miRNA regulating gene expression in cells where it is not transcribed. Collectively, we demonstrate that HDL's anti-inflammatory properties are conferred, in part, through HDL-miR-223 delivery and translational repression of ICAM-1 in endothelial cells. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Clinical reasoning is a fundamental part of a physician's daily workflow. Yet it remains a challenging skill to develop formally, especially in preclerkship-level early learners. Traditionally, medical students learn clinical reasoning informally through experiential opportunities during their clerkship years. This occurs in contrast to the more structured, explicit learning of the basic sciences and physical diagnosis during the preclerkship years. To address this need, we present a flipped classroom case-based approach for developing clinical reasoning skills based on problem representation and the use of a structured illness script worksheet as a model. Methods: Students were given a short introduction via screencast to introduce clinical reasoning and related terminology such as problem representation and semantic qualifiers. They also received a case vignette and an illness script worksheet to prepare them for in-class discussion. Students used this worksheet to practice clinical reasoning in a small-group session that was held in our last organ system–based second-year course, prior to the start of the clerkships. Results: In comparison to the traditional facilitator-led small-group sessions, where students would sequentially answer a set of defined content-based questions to explore a clinical case, 80\% of students preferred the new framework that incorporates problem representation and the illness script worksheets. Faculty facilitators found the structure of the illness script worksheet helpful in leading a clinical reasoning small-group session. Discussion: Based on the results of this pilot, we plan to systematically implement this clinical reasoning framework in our preclerkship curriculum.},

	abstract = {Importance: Hereditary transthyretin (TTR) amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) due to the TTR V122I variant is an autosomal-dominant disorder that causes heart failure in elderly individuals of African ancestry. The clinical associations of carrying the variant, its effect in other African ancestry populations including Hispanic/Latino individuals, and the rates of achieving a clinical diagnosis in carriers are unknown.
Objective: To assess the association between the TTR V122I variant and heart failure and identify rates of hATTR-CM diagnosis among carriers with heart failure.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional analysis of carriers and noncarriers of TTR V122I of African ancestry aged 50 years or older enrolled in the Penn Medicine Biobank between 2008 and 2017 using electronic health record data from 1996 to 2017. Case-control study in participants of African and Hispanic/Latino ancestry with and without heart failure in the Mount Sinai BioMe Biobank enrolled between 2007 and 2015 using electronic health record data from 2007 to 2018.
Exposures: TTR V122I carrier status.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was prevalent heart failure. The rate of diagnosis with hATTR-CM among TTR V122I carriers with heart failure was measured.
Results: The cross-sectional cohort included 3724 individuals of African ancestry with a median age of 64 years (interquartile range, 57-71); 1755 (47\%) were male, 2896 (78\%) had a diagnosis of hypertension, and 753 (20\%) had a history of myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization. There were 116 TTR V122I carriers (3.1\%); 1121 participants (30\%) had heart failure. The case-control study consisted of 2307 individuals of African ancestry and 3663 Hispanic/Latino individuals; the median age was 73 years (interquartile range, 68-80), 2271 (38\%) were male, 4709 (79\%) had a diagnosis of hypertension, and 1008 (17\%) had a history of myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization. There were 1376 cases of heart failure. TTR V122I was associated with higher rates of heart failure (cross-sectional cohort: n = 51/116 TTR V122I carriers [44\%], n = 1070/3608 noncarriers [30\%], adjusted odds ratio, 1.7 [95\% CI, 1.2-2.4], P = .006; case-control study: n = 36/1376 heart failure cases [2.6\%], n = 82/4594 controls [1.8\%], adjusted odds ratio, 1.8 [95\% CI, 1.2-2.7], P = .008). Ten of 92 TTR V122I carriers with heart failure (11\%) were diagnosed as having hATTR-CM; the median time from onset of symptoms to clinical diagnosis was 3 years.
Conclusions and Relevance: Among individuals of African or Hispanic/Latino ancestry enrolled in 2 academic medical center-based biobanks, the TTR V122I genetic variant was significantly associated with heart failure.},

	abstract = {Background: Approximately 13\% of black individuals carry 2 copies of the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk alleles G1 or G2, which are associated with 1.5- to 2.5-fold increased risk of chronic kidney disease. There have been conflicting reports as to whether an association exists between APOL1 risk alleles and cardiovascular disease (CVD) that is independent of the effects of APOL1 on kidney disease. We sought to test the association of APOL1 G1/G2 alleles with coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and stroke among black individuals in the Million Veteran Program. Methods: We performed a time-to-event analysis of retrospective electronic health record data using Cox proportional hazard and competing-risks Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard models. The primary exposure was APOL1 risk allele status. The primary outcome was incident coronary artery disease among individuals without chronic kidney disease during the 12.5-year follow-up period. We separately analyzed the cross-sectional association of APOL1 risk allele status with lipid traits and 115 cardiovascular diseases using phenome-wide association. Results: Among 30 903 black Million Veteran Program participants, 3941 (13\%) carried the 2 APOL1 risk allele high-risk genotype. Individuals with normal kidney function at baseline with 2 risk alleles had slightly higher risk of developing coronary artery disease compared with those with no risk alleles (hazard ratio, 1.11 [95\% CI, 1.01-1.21]; P=0.039). Similarly, modest associations were identified with incident stroke (hazard ratio, 1.20 [95\% CI, 1.05-1.36; P=0.007) and peripheral artery disease (hazard ratio, 1.15 [95\% CI, 1.01-1.29l; P=0.031). When both cardiovascular and renal outcomes were modeled, APOL1 was strongly associated with incident renal disease, whereas no significant association with the CVD end points could be detected. Cardiovascular phenome-wide association analyses did not identify additional significant associations with CVD subsets. Conclusions: APOL1 risk variants display a modest association with CVD, and this association is likely mediated by the known APOL1 association with chronic kidney disease.},

Both chronic cardiometabolic risk factors and genetics have been shown to contribute to the development of atrial fibrillation. Birthweight has also been associated with risk of atrial fibrillation. Methods: In the current study, we utilized a genetic approach to study the effect of birthweight on atrial fibrillation. We used 2-sample Mendelian randomization to consider the impact of birthweight on incident atrial fibrillation using summary data from the Early Growth Genetics Consortium GWAS of birthweight and a large biobank-based GWAS of atrial fibrillation. Results: Using the framework of 2-sample Mendelian randomization, we found that a 1-SD genetic elevation of birthweight was associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 1.27 [95\% CI, 1.14-1.41]; P=1×10-5) with sensitivity analyses demonstrating robustness of this result.

	abstract = {Purpose: “Genome-first” approaches, in which genetic sequencing is agnostically linked to associated phenotypes, can enhance our understanding of rare variants’ contributions to disease. Loss-of-function variants in LMNA cause a range of rare diseases, including cardiomyopathy. Methods: We leveraged exome sequencing from 11,451 unselected individuals in the Penn Medicine Biobank to associate rare variants in LMNA with diverse electronic health record (EHR)–derived phenotypes. We used Rare Exome Variant Ensemble Learner (REVEL) to annotate rare missense variants, clustered predicted deleterious and loss-of-function variants into a “gene burden” (N = 72 individuals), and performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). Major findings were replicated in DiscovEHR. Results: The LMNA gene burden was significantly associated with primary cardiomyopathy (p = 1.78E-11) and cardiac conduction disorders (p = 5.27E-07). Most patients had not been clinically diagnosed with LMNA cardiomyopathy. We also noted an association with chronic kidney disease (p = 1.13E-06). Regression analyses on echocardiography and serum labs revealed that LMNA variant carriers had dilated cardiomyopathy and primary renal disease. Conclusion: Pathogenic LMNA variants are an underdiagnosed cause of cardiomyopathy. We also find that LMNA loss of function may be a primary cause of renal disease. Finally, we show the value of aggregating rare, annotated variants into a gene burden and using PheWAS to identify novel ontologies for pleiotropic human genes.},

Although genetic variation in the type 1 cannabinoid receptor - encoded by the CNR1 gene - is known to influence high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level as well, human studies conducted to date have been limited to genetic markers such as haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms. Here we identify rs806371 in the CNR1 promoter as the causal variant. We re-sequence the CNR1 gene and genotype all variants in a DNA biobank linked to comprehensive electronic medical records. By testing each variant for association with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in a clinical practice-based setting, we localize a putative functional allele to a 100-bp window in the 5′-flanking region. Assessment of variants in this window for functional impact on electrophoretic mobility shift assay identifies rs806371 as a novel regulatory binding element. Reporter gene assays confirm that rs806371 reduces gene expression, thereby linking CNR1 gene variation to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in humans.},

	doi = {10.1093/hmg/ddab249},
	abstract = {'Genome-first' approaches to analyzing rare variants can reveal new insights into human biology and disease. Because pathogenic variants are often rare, new discovery requires aggregating rare coding variants into 'gene burdens' for sufficient power. However, a major challenge is deciding which variants to include in gene burden tests. Pathogenic variants in MYBPC3 and MYH7 are well-known causes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and focusing on these 'positive control' genes in a genome-first approach could help inform variant selection methods and gene burdening strategies for other genes and diseases. Integrating exome sequences with electronic health records among 41 759 participants in the Penn Medicine BioBank, we evaluated the performance of aggregating predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) and/or predicted deleterious missense (pDM) variants in MYBPC3 and MYH7 for gene burden phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). The approach to grouping rare variants for these two genes produced very different results: pLOFs but not pDM variants in MYBPC3 were strongly associated with HCM, whereas the opposite was true for MYH7. Detailed review of clinical charts revealed that only 38.5\% of patients with HCM diagnoses carrying an HCM-associated variant in MYBPC3 or MYH7 had a clinical genetic test result. Additionally, 26.7\% of MYBPC3 pLOF carriers without HCM diagnoses had clear evidence of left atrial enlargement and/or septal/LV hypertrophy on echocardiography. Our study shows the importance of evaluating both pLOF and pDM variants for gene burden testing in future studies to uncover novel gene-disease relationships and identify new pathogenic loss-of-function variants across the human genome through genome-first analyses of healthcare-based populations.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pmed.1003288},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies have identified height as a strong risk factor for atrial fibrillation, but this finding may be limited by residual confounding. We aimed to examine genetic variation in height within the Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to determine whether height has a causal effect on risk of atrial fibrillation.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In summary-level analyses, MR was performed using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of height (GIANT/UK Biobank; 693,529 individuals) and atrial fibrillation (AFGen; 65,446 cases and 522,744 controls), finding that each 1-SD increase in genetically predicted height increased the odds of atrial fibrillation (odds ratio [OR] 1.34; 95\% CI 1.29 to 1.40; p = 5 × 10-42). This result remained consistent in sensitivity analyses with MR methods that make different assumptions about the presence of pleiotropy, and when accounting for the effects of traditional cardiovascular risk factors on atrial fibrillation. Individual-level phenome-wide association studies of height and a height genetic risk score were performed among 6,567 European-ancestry participants of the Penn Medicine Biobank (median age at enrollment 63 years, interquartile range 55-72; 38\% female; recruitment 2008-2015), confirming prior observational associations between height and atrial fibrillation. Individual-level MR confirmed that each 1-SD increase in height increased the odds of atrial fibrillation, including adjustment for clinical and echocardiographic confounders (OR 1.89; 95\% CI 1.50 to 2.40; p = 0.007). The main limitations of this study include potential bias from pleiotropic effects of genetic variants, and lack of generalizability of individual-level findings to non-European populations.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed evidence that height is likely a positive causal risk factor for atrial fibrillation. Further study is needed to determine whether risk prediction tools including height or anthropometric risk factors can be used to improve screening and primary prevention of atrial fibrillation, and whether biological pathways involved in height may offer new targets for treatment of atrial fibrillation.},

Objective: To determine the association between genetic liability to smoking and risk of CAD, PAD, and large-artery stroke.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Mendelian randomization study using summary statistics from genome-wide associations of smoking (UK Biobank; up to 462 690 individuals), CAD (Coronary Artery Disease Genome Wide Replication and Meta-analysis plus the Coronary Artery Disease Genetics Consortium; up to 60 801 cases, 123 504 controls), PAD (VA Million Veteran Program; up to 24 009 cases, 150 983 controls), and large-artery stroke (MEGASTROKE; up to 4373 cases, 406 111 controls). This study was conducted using summary statistic data from large, previously described cohorts. Review of those publications does not reveal the total recruitment dates for those cohorts. Data analyses were conducted from August 2019 to June 2020.
Exposures: Genetic liability to smoking (as proxied by genetic variants associated with lifetime smoking index).
Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk (odds ratios [ORs]) of CAD, PAD, and large-artery stroke.
Results: Genetic liability to smoking was associated with increased risk of PAD (OR, 2.13; 95\% CI, 1.78-2.56; P = 3.6 × 10-16), CAD (OR, 1.48; 95\% CI, 1.25-1.75; P = 4.4 × 10-6), and stroke (OR, 1.40; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.92; P = .04).

The association between genetic liability to smoking and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases remained independent from the effects of smoking on traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this mendelian randomization analysis of data from large studies of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, genetic liability to smoking was a strong risk factor for CAD, PAD, and stroke, although the estimated association was strongest between smoking and PAD. The association between smoking and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.},

To identify novel pleiotropic loci associated with atherosclerosis, we performed a joint analysis of their shared genetic architecture, along with that of common risk factors. Using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of nine known atherosclerotic (CAD, PAD) and atherosclerosis risk factors (body mass index, smoking initiation, type 2 diabetes, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and triglycerides), we perform 15 separate multi-trait genetic association scans which resulted in 25 novel pleiotropic loci not yet reported as genome-wide significant for their respective traits. Colocalization with single-tissue eQTLs identified candidate causal genes at 14 of the detected signals. Notably, the signal between PAD and LDL-C at the PCSK6 locus affects PCSK6 splicing in human liver tissue and induced pluripotent derived hepatocyte-like cells. These results show that joint analysis of related atherosclerotic disease traits and their risk factors allowed identification of unified biology that may offer the opportunity for therapeutic manipulation. The signal at PCSK6 represent possible shared causal biology where existing inhibitors may be able to be leveraged for novel therapies.},

	abstract = {We report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of coronary artery disease (CAD) incorporating nearly a quarter of a million cases, in which existing studies are integrated with data from cohorts of white, Black and Hispanic individuals from the Million Veteran Program. We document near equivalent heritability of CAD across multiple ancestral groups, identify 95 novel loci, including nine on the X chromosome, detect eight loci of genome-wide significance in Black and Hispanic individuals, and demonstrate that two common haplotypes at the 9p21 locus are responsible for risk stratification in all populations except those of African origin, in which these haplotypes are virtually absent. Moreover, in the largest GWAS for angiographically derived coronary atherosclerosis performed to date, we find 15 loci of genome-wide significance that robustly overlap with established loci for clinical CAD. Phenome-wide association analyses of novel loci and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) augment signals related to insulin resistance, extend pleiotropic associations of these loci to include smoking and family history, and precisely document the markedly reduced transferability of existing PRSs to Black individuals. Downstream integrative analyses reinforce the critical roles of vascular endothelial, fibroblast, and smooth muscle cells in CAD susceptibility, but also point to a shared biology between atherosclerosis and oncogenesis. This study highlights the value of diverse populations in further characterizing the genetic architecture of CAD.},

The ColocQuiaL pipeline provides a framework to perform these colocalization analyses at scale across the genome and returns summary files and locus visualization plots to allow for detailed review of the results.

	abstract = {Pharmacologic activation of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism is protective in models of heart failure (HF). How protection occurs remains unclear, although a causative block in cardiac BCAA oxidation is widely assumed. Here, we use in vivo isotope infusions to show that cardiac BCAA oxidation in fact increases, rather than decreases, in HF. Moreover, cardiac-specific activation of BCAA oxidation does not protect from HF even though systemic activation does. Lowering plasma and cardiac BCAAs also fails to confer significant protection, suggesting alternative mechanisms of protection. Surprisingly, activation of BCAA catabolism lowers blood pressure (BP), a known cardioprotective mechanism. BP lowering occurred independently of nitric oxide and reflected vascular resistance to adrenergic constriction. Mendelian randomization studies revealed that elevated plasma BCAAs portend higher BP in humans. Together, these data indicate that BCAA oxidation lowers vascular resistance, perhaps in part explaining cardioprotection in HF that is not mediated directly in cardiomyocytes.},

	abstract = {Background:
              Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a life-threatening vascular event with environmental and genetic determinants. Recent VTE genome-wide association studies (GWAS) meta-analyses involved nearly 30 000 VTE cases and identified up to 40 genetic loci associated with VTE risk, including loci not previously suspected to play a role in hemostasis. The aim of our research was to expand discovery of new genetic loci associated with VTE by using cross-ancestry genomic resources.
            
            
              Methods:
              We present new cross-ancestry meta-analyzed GWAS results involving up to 81 669 VTE cases from 30 studies, with replication of novel loci in independent populations and loci characterization through in silico genomic interrogations.
            
            
              Results:
              In our genetic discovery effort that included 55 330 participants with VTE (47 822 European, 6320 African, and 1188 Hispanic ancestry), we identified 48 novel associations, of which 34 were replicated after correction for multiple testing. In our combined discovery-replication analysis (81 669 VTE participants) and ancestry-stratified meta-analyses (European, African, and Hispanic), we identified another 44 novel associations, which are new candidate VTE-associated loci requiring replication. In total, across all GWAS meta-analyses, we identified 135 independent genomic loci significantly associated with VTE risk. A genetic risk score of the significantly associated loci in Europeans identified a 6-fold increase in risk for those in the top 1\% of scores compared with those with average scores. We also identified 31 novel transcript associations in transcriptome-wide association studies and 8 novel candidate genes with protein quantitative-trait locus Mendelian randomization analyses. In silico interrogations of hemostasis and hematology traits and a large phenome-wide association analysis of the 135 GWAS loci provided insights to biological pathways contributing to VTE, with some loci contributing to VTE through well-characterized coagulation pathways and others providing new data on the role of hematology traits, particularly platelet function. Many of the replicated loci are outside of known or currently hypothesized pathways to thrombosis.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Our cross-ancestry GWAS meta-analyses identified new loci associated with VTE. These findings highlight new pathways to thrombosis and provide novel molecules that may be useful in the development of improved antithrombosis treatments.},

However, the contribution of common genetic variation to heart failure risk has not been fully elucidated, particularly in comparison to other common cardiometabolic traits. We report a multi-ancestry genome-wide association study meta-analysis of all-cause heart failure including up to 115,150 cases and 1,550,331 controls of diverse genetic ancestry, identifying 47 risk loci. We also perform multivariate genome-wide association studies that integrate heart failure with related cardiac magnetic resonance imaging endophenotypes, identifying 61 risk loci. Gene-prioritization analyses including colocalization and transcriptome-wide association studies identify known and previously unreported candidate cardiomyopathy genes and cellular processes, which we validate in gene-expression profiling of failing and healthy human hearts. Colocalization, gene expression profiling, and Mendelian randomization provide convergent evidence for the roles of BCKDHA and circulating branch-chain amino acids in heart failure and cardiac structure. Finally, proteome-wide Mendelian randomization identifies 9 circulating proteins associated with heart failure or quantitative imaging traits. These analyses highlight similarities and differences among heart failure and associated cardiovascular imaging endophenotypes, implicate common genetic variation in the pathogenesis of heart failure, and identify circulating proteins that may represent cardiomyopathy treatment targets.},

	abstract = {The study aims to determine the shared genetic architecture between COVID-19 severity with existing medical conditions using electronic health record (EHR) data. We conducted a Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) of genetic variants associated with critical illness (n = 35) or hospitalization (n = 42) due to severe COVID-19 using genome-wide association summary data from the Host Genetics Initiative. PheWAS analysis was performed using genotype-phenotype data from the Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program (MVP). Phenotypes were defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes mapped to clinically relevant groups using published PheWAS methods. Among 658,582 Veterans, variants associated with severe COVID-19 were tested for association across 1,559 phenotypes. Variants at the ABO locus (rs495828, rs505922) associated with the largest number of phenotypes (nrs495828 = 53 and nrs505922 = 59); strongest association with venous embolism, odds ratio (ORrs495828 1.33 (p = 1.32 x 10−199), and thrombosis ORrs505922 1.33, p = 2.2 x10-265. Among 67 respiratory conditions tested, 11 had significant associations including MUC5B locus (rs35705950) with increased risk of idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis OR 2.83, p = 4.12 × 10−191; CRHR1 (rs61667602) associated with reduced risk of pulmonary fibrosis, OR 0.84, p = 2.26× 10−12. The TYK2 locus (rs11085727) associated with reduced risk for autoimmune conditions, e.g., psoriasis OR 0.88, p = 6.48 x10-23, lupus OR 0.84, p = 3.97 x 10−06. PheWAS stratified by ancestry demonstrated differences in genotype-phenotype associations. LMNA (rs581342) associated with neutropenia OR 1.29 p = 4.1 x 10−13 among Veterans of African and Hispanic ancestry but not European. Overall, we observed a shared genetic architecture between COVID-19 severity and conditions related to underlying risk factors for severe and poor COVID-19 outcomes. Differing associations between genotype-phenotype across ancestries may inform heterogenous outcomes observed with COVID-19. Divergent associations between risk for severe COVID-19 with autoimmune inflammatory conditions both respiratory and non-respiratory highlights the shared pathways and fine balance of immune host response and autoimmunity and caution required when considering treatment targets.},

A polygenic risk score for FMD (PRSFMD) was constructed from prior genome-wide association findings of 584 FMD cases and 7139 controls and evaluated for association with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in a cohort of 9693 AAA cases and 294 049 controls. A previously published PRSAAA was also assessed among the FMD cases and controls.
RESULTS: 9.3\% (43) of all first-degree relatives of probands were diagnosed with FMD, aneurysms, and dissections. Aneurysmal disease occurred in 60.5\% of affected relatives and 5.6\% of all relatives. Among 227 female first-degree relatives of probands, 4.8\% (11) had FMD, representing a relative risk (RR)FMD of 1.5 ([95\% CI, 0.75-2.8]; P=0.19) compared with the estimated population prevalence of 3.3\%, though not of statistical significance. 11\% (8 of 72) of FMD proband fathers had AAAs resulting in a RRAAA of 2.3 ([95\% CI, 1.12-4.6]; P=0.014) compared with population estimates. The PRSFMD was found to be associated with an AAA (odds ratio, 1.03 [95\% CI, 1.01-1.05]; P=2.6×10-3), and the PRSAAA was found to be associated with FMD (odds ratio, 1.53 [95\% CI, 1.2-1.9]; P=9.0×10-5) as well.
CONCLUSIONS: FMD and AAAs seem to be sex-dimorphic manifestations of a heritable arterial disease with a partially shared complex genetic architecture. Excess risk of having an AAA according to a family history of FMD may justify screening in family members of individuals having FMD.},

	abstract = {Background:

Observational studies identified elevated blood pressure (BP) as a strong risk factor for thoracic aortic dilation, and BP reduction is the primary medical intervention recommended to prevent progression of aortic aneurysms. However, although BP may impact aortic dilation, aortic size may also impact BP. The causal relationship between BP and thoracic aortic size has not been reliably established.

Methods:

Genome-wide association studies summary statistics were obtained for BP and ascending thoracic aortic diameter (AscAoD). Causal effects of BP on AscAoD were estimated using 2-sample Mendelian randomization using a range of pleiotropy-robust methods.

Results:

Genetically predicted increased systolic BP, diastolic BP, and mean arterial pressure all significantly associate with higher AscAoD (systolic BP: β estimate, 0.0041 mm/mm Hg [95\% CI, 0.0008–0.0074]; P=0.02, diastolic BP: β estimate, 0.0272 mm/mm Hg [95\% CI, 0.0224–0.0320]; P{\textless}0.001, and mean arterial pressure: β estimate, 0.0168 mm/mm Hg [95\% CI, 0.0130–0.0206]; P{\textless}0.001). Genetically predicted pulse pressure, meanwhile, had an inverse association with AscAoD (β estimate, −0.0155 mm/mm Hg [95\% CI, −0.0213 to −0.0096]; P{\textless}0.001). Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses showed that genetically predicted increased mean arterial pressure and reduced pulse pressure were independently associated with AscAoD. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization demonstrated that genetically predicted AscAoD was inversely associated with pulse pressure (β estimate, −2.0721 mm Hg/mm [95\% CI, −3.1137 to −1.0306]; P{\textless}0.001) and systolic BP (β estimate, −1.2878 mm Hg/mm [95\% CI, −2.3533 to −0.2224]; P=0.02), while directly associated with diastolic BP (0.8203 mm Hg/mm [95\% CI, 0.2735–1.3672]; P=0.004).

Conclusions:

BP likely contributes causally to ascending thoracic aortic dilation. Increased AscAoD likely contributes to lower systolic BP and pulse pressure, but not diastolic BP, consistent with the hemodynamic consequences of a reduced aortic diameter.},

Although varicose veins are heritable and epidemiologic studies have identified several candidate varicose vein risk factors, the molecular and genetic basis remains uncertain. Here we analyzed the contribution of common genetic variants to varicose veins using data from the Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program and four other large biobanks. Among 49,765 individuals with varicose veins and 1,334,301 disease-free controls, we identified 139 risk loci. We identified genetic overlap between varicose veins, other vascular diseases and dozens of anthropometric factors. Using Mendelian randomization, we prioritized therapeutic targets via integration of proteomic and transcriptomic data. Finally, topological enrichment analyses confirmed the biologic roles of endothelial shear flow disruption, inflammation, vascular remodeling and angiogenesis.

	abstract = {Background: Plasma triglycerides (TGs) are causally associated with coronary artery disease and acute pancreatitis. Apolipoprotein A-V (apoA-V, gene APOA5) is a liver-secreted protein that is carried on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and promotes the enzymatic activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), thereby reducing TG levels. Little is known about apoA-V structure-function; naturally occurring human APOA5 variants can provide novel insights. Methods: We used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to determine the secondary structure of human apoA-V in lipid-free and lipid-associated conditions and identified a C-terminal hydrophobic face. Then, we used genomic data in the Penn Medicine Biobank to identify a rare variant, Q252X, predicted to specifically eliminate this region. We interrogated the function of apoA-V Q252X using recombinant protein in vitro and in vivo in apoa5 knockout mice. Results: Human apoA-V Q252X carriers exhibited elevated plasma TG levels consistent with loss of function. Apoa5 knockout mice injected with AAV vectors expressing wildtype and variant APOA5-AAV recapitulated this phenotype. Part of the loss of function is due to reduced mRNA expression. Functionally, recombinant apoA-V Q252X was more readily soluble in aqueous solutions and more exchangeable with lipoproteins than WT apoA-V. Despite lacking the C-terminal hydrophobic region (a putative lipid binding domain) this protein also decreased plasma TG in vivo. Conclusions: Deletion of apoA-V's C-terminus leads to reduced apoA-V bioavailability in vivo and higher TG levels. However, the C-terminus is not required for lipoprotein binding or enhancement of intravascular lipolytic activity. WT apoA-V is highly prone to aggregation, and this property is markedly reduced in recombinant apoA-V lacking the C-terminus.},

Replicated was sought in a case-control study of 28 123 PAD cases and 128 459 controls from the veterans affairs Million Veteran Program (MVP) and a cohort study of 452 028 individuals from the UK Biobank study (UKB).

Observational analyses demonstrated a U-shaped association between sleep duration and PAD risk. In Swedish adults, incident PAD risk was higher in those with short sleep [\&lt;5 h; hazard ratio (HR) 1.74; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.31–2.31] or long sleep (≥8 h; HR 1.24; 95\% CI 1.08–1.43), compared to individuals with a sleep duration of 7 to \&lt;8 h/night. This finding was supported by the analyses in MVP and UKB. Observational analysis also revealed positive associations between daytime napping (HR 1.32, 95\% CI 1.18–1.49) with PAD. MR analysis supported an inverse association between sleep duration [odds ratio (OR) per hour increase: 0.79, 95\% CI, 0.55, 0.89] and PAD and an association between short sleep and increased PAD (OR 1.20, 95\% CI, 1.04–1.38).Short sleep duration was associated with an increased risk of PAD.},

	abstract = {Aims/Hypothesis Individuals with T2D are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications; early identification of individuals can lead to an alteration of the natural history of the disease. Current approaches to risk prediction tailored to individuals with T2D are exemplified by the RECODe algorithms which predict CVD outcomes among individuals with T2D. Recent efforts to improve CVD risk prediction among the general population have included the incorporation of polygenic risk scores (PRS). This paper aims to investigate the utility of the addition of a coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke and heart failure risk score to the current RECODe model for disease stratification.
Methods We derived PRS using summary statistics for ischemic stroke (IS) from the coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure (HF) and tested prediction accuracy in the Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB). A Cox proportional hazards model was used for time-to-event analyses within our cohort, and we compared model discrimination for the RECODe model with and without a PRS using AUC.
Results The RECODe model alone demonstrated an AUC [95\% CI] of 0.67 [0.62-0.72] for ASCVD; the addition of the three PRS to the model demonstrated an AUC [95\% CI] of 0.66 [0.63-0.70]. A z-test to compare the AUCs of the two models did not demonstrate a detectable difference between the two models (p=0.97)
Conclusions/Interpretation In the present study, we demonstrate that although PRS associate with CVD outcomes independent of traditional risk factors among individuals with T2D, the addition of PRS to contemporary clinical risk models does not specifically improve the predictive performance as compared to the baseline model.
Research in ContextEarly identification of individuals with T2D who are at greatest risk of cardiovascular complications can lead to targeted intensive risk-factor modification with the aim of altering the natural history of the disease.Current approaches to risk prediction tailored to individuals with diabetes are exemplified by the RECODe algorithms which predict both individual and composite CVD outcomes among individuals with T2D.We sought to determine if the addition of a polygenic risk score to current clinical risk models improve predictive modeling of adverse cardiovascular events in individuals with type II diabetes.We demonstrate that although PRS associate with CVD outcomes independent of traditional risk factors among individuals with T2D, the addition of PRS to traditional, validated models does not specifically improve the predictive performance as compared to the base model.RECODe demonstrated modest discrimination potential at baseline (AUC = 0.66). As such, the lack of improved risk prediction may reflect the performance of the RECODe equation in our cohort as opposed to lack of PRS utility.Current performance of clinical risk models appears modest. Although PRS doesn’t meaningfully improve performance, there is still substantial opportunity to improve risk prediction.},

	abstract = {Aims The study aimed to discover novel genetic loci for atrial fibrillation (AF), explore the shared genetic etiologies between AF and other cardiovascular and cardiometabolic traits, and uncover AF pathogenesis using Mendelian randomization analysis. Methods and results We conducted a genome-wide association study meta-analysis including 109,787 AF cases and 1,165,920 controls of European ancestry and identified 215 loci, among which 91 were novel. We performed Genomic Structural Equation Modeling analysis between AF and four cardiovascular comorbidities (coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, heart failure, and vneous thromboembolism) and found 189 loci shared across these diseases as well as a universal genetic locus shared by atherosclerotic outcomes (i.e., rs1537373 near CDKN2B). Three genetic loci (rs10740129 near JMJD1C, rs2370982 near NRXN3, and rs9931494 near FTO) were associated with AF and cardiometabolic traits. A polygenic risk score derived from this genome-wide meta-analysis was associated with AF risk (odds ratio 2.36, 95\% confidence interval 2.31-2.41 per standard deviation increase) in the UK biobank. This score, combined with age, sex, and basic clinical features, predicted AF risk (AUC 0.784, 95\% CI 0.781-0.787) in Europeans. Phenome-wide association analysis of the polygenic risk score identified many AF-related comorbidities of the circulatory, endocrine, and respiratory systems. Phenome-wide and multi-omic Mendelian randomization analyses identified associations of blood lipids and pressure, diabetes, insomnia, obesity, short sleep, and smoking, 27 blood proteins, one gut microbe (genus.Catenibacterium), and 11 blood metabolites with risk to AF.

The concept of a non-case is introduced to allow for the imputation of the missing genuine cases. The odds ratio parameter of the genuine cases compared to controls is of interest. The imputation procedure predicts the probability of being a genuine case compared to a non-case semiparametrically in a dimension reduction fashion. This procedure is flexible, and vastly generalizes the existing methods. We establish the root-n asymptotic normality of the odds ratio parameter estimator. Our method yields stable odds ratio parameter estimation owing to the application of an efficient semiparametric sufficient dimension reduction estimator.

	abstract = {Background The genetic risk of intracranial aneurysm (IA) development has been ascribed largely to the genetic risk of smoking exposure and hypertension. However, the relationship of IA to other cardiovascular traits and the contribution of IA risk loci to aberrant gene programs within cerebrovascular cell types remains unclear.
Methods We performed a genome-wide association study in the Million Veteran Program testing association of roughly 25 million DNA variants with unruptured IA (3,165 cases and 592,927 controls) in veterans of European, African, and Hispanic ancestries. This was meta-analyzed with publicly available summary statistics to yield a final cohort of 15,438 cases and 1,183,973 controls. Candidate causal genes were prioritized through expression quantitative trait loci colocalization, fine-mapping transcriptome wide association studies, and multi-trait colocalization. We constructed a cerebrovascular single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) dataset and integrated IA summary statistics to prioritize candidate causal cell types. We then constructed a polygenic risk score to identify patients at greater risk of developing IA.
Results We identified five novel loci association with IA, increasing the number of known susceptibility loci to 22. At these susceptibility loci, we prioritized 16 candidate causal genes. Amongst other cardiovascular traits, we found a significant positive genetic correlation of IA with coronary artery disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm, and we identified 13 IA risk loci that colocalize with aneurysmal, atherosclerotic, and blood pressure traits. Integration of an IA gene set with human cerebrovascular snRNA-seq data revealed significant association with matrix-producing pericytes, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and other mural subtypes. In addition, gene expression analysis revealed enrichment of several candidate genes within SMCs and pericytes. Finally, a high polygenic risk score (PRS) was significantly associated with IA across European (OR: 1.87, CI: 1.61-2.17, P = 8.8 × 10−17), African (OR: 1.62, CI: 1.19-2.15, P = 1.2 × 10−3), and Hispanic (OR: 2.28, CI: 1.47-3.38, P = 1.0 × 10−4) ancestries.
Conclusion Here, we identify five novel loci associated with IA. Integration of summary statistics with cerebrovascular snRNA-seq reveals association of cell-types involved in matrix production. We constructed and validated a PRS that predicts IA, while controlling for demographic variables including smoking status, sex, and blood pressure. Taken together, our findings suggest that an intrinsic deficit in matrix production and vascular integrity may drive IA pathogenesis independent of systemic hypertension and smoking exposure.},

	abstract = {Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common disease with substantial heritability. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis from 14 discovery cohorts and uncovered 141 independent associations, including 97 previously unreported loci. A polygenic risk score derived from meta-analysis explained AAA risk beyond clinical risk factors. Genes at AAA risk loci indicate involvement of lipid metabolism, vascular development and remodeling, extracellular matrix dysregulation and inflammation as key mechanisms in AAA pathogenesis. These genes also indicate overlap between the development of AAA and other monogenic aortopathies, particularly via transforming growth factor β signaling. Motivated by the strong evidence for the role of lipid metabolism in AAA, we used Mendelian randomization to establish the central role of nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol in AAA and identified the opportunity for repurposing of proprotein convertase, subtilisin/kexin-type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. This was supported by a study demonstrating that PCSK9 loss of function prevented the development of AAA in a preclinical mouse model.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is a complex, multifactorial disease associated with substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although it is frequently assessed using BMI, many epidemiological studies have shown links between body fat distribution and obesity-related outcomes. This study examined the relationships between body fat distribution and metabolic syndrome traits using Mendelian Randomization (MR).
METHODS/FINDINGS: Genetic variants associated with visceral adipose tissue (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT), and gluteofemoral adipose tissue (GFAT), as well as their relative ratios, were identified from a genome wide association study (GWAS) performed with the United Kingdom BioBank. GWAS summary statistics for traits and outcomes related to metabolic syndrome were obtained from the IEU Open GWAS Project. Two-sample MR and BMI-controlled multivariable MR (MVMR) were performed to examine relationships between each body fat measure and ratio with the outcomes. Increases in absolute GFAT were associated with a protective cardiometabolic profile, including lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol (β: -0.19, [95\% CI: -0.28, -0.10], p {\textless} 0.001), higher high density lipoprotein cholesterol (β: 0.23, [95\% CI: 0.03, 0.43], p = 0.025), lower triglycerides (β: -0.28, [95\% CI: -0.45, -0.10], p = 0.0021), and decreased systolic (β: -1.65, [95\% CI: -2.69, -0.61], p = 0.0019) and diastolic blood pressures (β: -0.95, [95\% CI: -1.65, -0.25], p = 0.0075). These relationships were largely maintained in BMI-controlled MVMR analyses. Decreases in relative GFAT were linked with a worse cardiometabolic profile, with higher levels of detrimental lipids and increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures.
CONCLUSION: A MR analysis of ASAT, GFAT, and VAT depots and their relative ratios with metabolic syndrome related traits and outcomes revealed that increased absolute and relative GFAT were associated with a favorable cardiometabolic profile independently of BMI. These associations highlight the importance of body fat distribution in obesity and more precise means to categorize obesity beyond BMI.},

This has raised questions about the effect of TTNtvs in diverse populations, especially among individuals genetically similar to African reference populations. Objective: To determine the effect of TTNtvs on risk of DCM in diverse population as measured by genetic distance (GD) in principal component (PC) space. Design: Cohort study Setting: Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB) is a large, diverse biobank. Participants: Participants were recruited from across the Penn Medicine healthcare system and volunteered to have their electronic health records linked to biospecimen data including DNA which has undergone whole exome sequencing. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk of DCM among individuals carrying a hiPSI TTNtv. Results: Carrying a hiPSI TTNtv was associated with DCM among PMBB participants across a range of GD deciles from the 1000G European centroid; the effect estimates ranged from odds ratio (OR) = 3.29 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.26 to 8.56) to OR = 9.39 (95\% CI 3.82 to 23.13). When individuals were assigned to population subgroups based on genetic similarity to the 1000G reference populations, hiPSI TTNtvs conferred significant risk of DCM among those genetically similar to the 1000G European reference population (OR = 7.55, 95\% CI 4.99 to 11.42, P{\textless}0.001) and individuals genetically similar to the 1000G African reference population (OR 3.50, 95\% CI 1.48 to 8.24, P=0.004). Conclusions and Relevance: TTNtvs are associated with increased risk of DCM among a diverse cohort. There is no significant difference in effect of TTNtvs on DCM risk across deciles of GD from the 1000G European centroid, suggesting genetic background should not be considered when screening individuals for titin-related DCM.},

	abstract = {Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been identified as a causal risk factor for multiple forms of cardiovascular disease. Although observational evidence has linked MDD to peripheral artery disease (PAD), causal evidence of this relationship is lacking.

Methods and Results

Inverse variance weighted 2‐sample Mendelian randomization was used to test the association the between genetic liability for MDD and genetic liability for PAD. Genetic liability for MDD was associated with increased genetic liability for PAD (odds ratio [OR], 1.17 [95\% CI, 1.06–1.29]; P=2.6×10−3). Genetic liability for MDD was also associated with increased genetically determined lifetime smoking (β=0.11 [95\% CI, 0.078–0.14]; P=1.2×10−12), decreased alcohol intake (β=−0.078 [95\% CI, −0.15 to 0]; P=0.043), and increased body mass index (β=0.10 [95\% CI, 0.02–0.19]; P=1.8×10−2), which in turn were associated with genetic liability for PAD (smoking: OR, 2.81 [95\% CI, 2.28–3.47], P=9.8×10−22; alcohol: OR, 0.77 [95\% CI, 0.66–0.88]; P=1.8×10−4; body mass index: OR, 1.61 [95\% CI, 1.52–1.7]; P=1.3×10−57). Controlling for lifetime smoking index, alcohol intake, and body mass index with multivariable Mendelian randomization completely attenuated the association between genetic liability for MDD with genetic liability for PAD.

Conclusions

This work provides evidence for a possible causal association between MDD and PAD that is dependent on intermediate risk factors, adding to the growing body of evidence suggesting that effective management and treatment of cardiovascular diseases may require a composite of physical and mental health interventions.},

Identifying novel molecular drivers of disease progression in heart failure (HF) is a high‐priority goal that may provide new therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes. The authors investigated the relationship between plasma proteins and adverse outcomes in HF and their putative causal role using Mendelian randomization.

Methods and Results

The authors measured 4776 plasma proteins among 1964 participants with HF with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction enrolled in PHFS (Penn Heart Failure Study). Assessed were the observational relationship between plasma proteins and (1) all‐cause death or (2) death or HF‐related hospital admission (DHFA). The authors replicated nominally significant associations in the Washington University HF registry (N=1080). Proteins significantly associated with outcomes were the subject of 2‐sample Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses. After correction for multiple testing, 243 and 126 proteins were found to be significantly associated with death and DHFA, respectively. These included small ubiquitin–like modifier 2 (standardized hazard ratio [sHR], 1.56; P{\textless}0.0001), growth differentiation factor‐15 (sHR, 1.68; P{\textless}0.0001) for death, A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs–like protein (sHR, 1.40; P{\textless}0.0001), and pulmonary‐associated surfactant protein C (sHR, 1.24; P{\textless}0.0001) for DHFA. In pathway analyses, top canonical pathways associated with death and DHFA included fibrotic, inflammatory, and coagulation pathways. Genomic analyses provided evidence of nominally significant associations between levels of 6 genetically predicted proteins with DHFA and 11 genetically predicted proteins with death.

Conclusions

This study implicates multiple novel proteins in HF and provides preliminary evidence of associations between genetically predicted plasma levels of 17 candidate proteins and the risk for adverse outcomes in human HF.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Supervised exercise therapy improves walking performance, functional capacity, and quality of life in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, few patients with PAD are enrolled in supervised exercise programs, and there are a number of logistical and financial barriers to their participation. A home-based walking intervention is likely to be more accessible to patients with PAD, but no fully home-based walking program has demonstrated efficacy. Concepts from behavioral economics have been used to design scalable interventions that increase daily physical activity in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease, but whether a similar program would be effective in patients with PAD is uncertain.
STUDY DESIGN AND OBJECTIVES: GAMEPAD (NCT04536012) is a pragmatic, virtual, randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a gamification strategy informed by concepts from behavioral economics to increase daily physical activity in patients with PAD who are seen in cardiology and vascular surgery clinics affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Patients are contacted by email or text message, and complete enrollment and informed consent on the Penn Way to Health online platform. A GAMEPAD substudy will evaluate the effectiveness of opt-in versus opt-out framing when approaching patients for study participation. Patients are then provided with a wearable fitness tracker, establish a baseline daily step count, set a goal to increase daily step count by 33\%-50\%, and are randomized 1:1 to the gamification or control arms. Interventions continue for 16 weeks, including a 4-week period during which goal step count is gradually increased in the gamification arm, with follow-up for an additional 8 weeks to evaluate the durability of behavior change. The trial has met its enrollment goal of 102 participants, with a primary endpoint of change from baseline in daily steps over the 16-week intervention period. Key secondary endpoints include change from baseline in daily steps over the 8-week postintervention follow-up period and changes in patient-reported measures of PAD symptoms and quality of life over the intervention and follow-up periods.
CONCLUSIONS: GAMEPAD is a virtual, pragmatic randomized clinical trial of a novel, fully home-based walking intervention informed by concepts from behavioral economics to increase physical activity and PAD-specific quality of life in patients with PAD. Its results will have important implications for the application of behavioral economic concepts to scalable home-based strategies to promote physical activity in patients with PAD and other disease processes where physical activity is limited by exertional symptoms.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:

Hundreds of biomarkers for peripheral artery disease (PAD) have been reported in the literature; however, the observational nature of these studies limits causal inference due to the potential of reverse causality and residual confounding. We sought to evaluate the potential causal impact of putative PAD biomarkers identified in human observational studies through genetic causal inference methods.

METHODS:

Putative circulating PAD biomarkers were identified from human observational studies through a comprehensive literature search based on terms related to PAD using PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase. Genetic instruments were generated from publicly available genome-wide association studies of circulating biomarkers. Two-sample Mendelian randomization was used to test the association of genetically determined biomarker levels with PAD using summary statistics from a genome-wide association study of 31 307 individuals with and 211 753 individuals without PAD in the VA Million Veteran Program and replicated in data from FinnGen comprised of 11 924 individuals with and 288 638 individuals without PAD.

RESULTS:

We identified 204 unique circulating biomarkers for PAD from the observational literature, of which 173 were genetically instrumented using genome-wide association study results. After accounting for multiple testing (false discovery rate, {\textless}0.05), 10 of 173 (5.8\%) biomarkers had significant associations with PAD. These 10 biomarkers represented categories including plasma lipoprotein regulation, lipid homeostasis, and protein-lipid complex remodeling. Observational literature highlighted different pathways including inflammatory response, negative regulation of multicellular organismal processes, and regulation of response to external stimuli.

CONCLUSIONS:

Integrating human observational studies and genetic causal inference highlights several key pathways in PAD pathophysiology. This work demonstrates that a substantial portion of biomarkers identified in observational studies are not well supported by human genetic evidence and emphasizes the importance of triangulating evidence to understand PAD pathophysiology. Although the identified biomarkers offer insights into atherosclerotic development in the lower limb, their specificity to PAD compared with more widespread atherosclerosis requires further study.},

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Genome-wide significant variants (p {\textless} 5x10 -8) were mapped to genes using physical distance and gene expression in skin. Genetic correlation between pilonidal sinus disease and morphometric, androgen-driven, and hair phenotypes was estimated with LD score regression. Finally, a genome-first approach to rare, predicted deleterious variants in hair shaft genes TCHH, PADI3, and TGM3 was conducted for association with pilonidal sinus disease via PennMedicine Biobank.
RESULTS: Genome-wide association study comprised of 2,835 individuals with pilonidal sinus disease identified 5 genome-wide significant loci, prioritizing HDAC9, TBX15, WARS2, RP11-293M10.1, PRKAR1B, TWIST1, GPATCH2L, NEK9, and EIF2B2, as putative causal genes; several of these genes have known roles in balding and hair patterning. There was significant correlation between the genetic background of pilonidal sinus disease and that of the androgen-driven hair traits male pattern baldness and young age at first facial hair. In a candidate analysis of genes associated with syndromic hair disorders, rare coding variants in TCHH, a monogenic cause of uncombable hair syndrome, were associated with increased prevalence of pilonidal sinus disease (OR 4.81 [5\% CI, 2.06-11.2]).
LIMITATIONS: This study is limited to European ancestry. However, because there is a higher incidence of pilonidal sinus disease in men of European ancestry, this analysis is focused on the at-risk population.
CONCLUSION: Genetic analysis of pilonidal sinus disease identified shared genetic architecture with hair biology and androgen-driven traits. As the first study investigating the genetic basis of pilonidal sinus disease, this provides biological insight into the long-appreciated connection between the disease state, male gender, and hair.

	abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is one of the most common, complex, heterogeneous diseases in the world, with over 1-3\% of the global population living with the condition. Progression of HF can be tracked via MRI measures of structural and functional changes to the heart, namely left ventricle (LV), including ejection fraction, mass, end-diastolic volume, and LV end-systolic volume. Moreover, while genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been a useful tool to identify candidate variants involved in HF risk, they lack crucial tissue-specific and mechanistic information which can be gained from incorporating additional data modalities. This study addresses this gap by incorporating transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide association studies (TWAS and PWAS) to gain insights into genetically-regulated changes in gene expression and protein abundance in precursors to HF measured using MRI-derived cardiac measures as well as full-stage all-cause HF. We identified several gene and protein overlaps between LV ejection fraction and end-systolic volume measures. Many of the overlaps identified in MRI-derived measurements through TWAS and PWAS appear to be shared with all-cause HF. We implicate many putative pathways relevant in HF associated with these genes and proteins via gene-set enrichment and protein-protein interaction network approaches. The results of this study (1) highlight the benefit of using multi-omics to better understand genetics and (2) provide novel insights as to how changes in heart structure and function may relate to HF.},

	abstract = {Elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms of risk are debated. Studies have found inconsistent associations between Lp(a) and measurements of atherosclerosis. We aimed to assess the relationship between Lp(a), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and coronary artery plaque severity.The study population consisted of participants of the Million Veteran Program who have undergone an invasive angiogram. The primary exposure was genetically predicted Lp(a) estimated by a polygenic score. Genetically predicted LDL-C was also assessed for comparison. The primary outcome was coronary artery plaque severity categorized as normal, non-obstructive disease, one-vessel disease, two-vessel disease, and three-vessel or left main disease. Among 18 927 adults of genetically inferred European ancestry and 4039 adults of genetically inferred African ancestry, we observed consistent associations between genetically predicted Lp(a) and obstructive coronary plaque, with effect sizes trending upward for increasingly severe categories of disease. Associations were independent of risk factors, clinically measured LDL-C and genetically predicted LDL-C. However, we did not find strong or consistent evidence for an association between genetically predicted Lp(a) and risk for non-obstructive plaque.Genetically predicted Lp(a) is positively associated with coronary plaque severity independent of LDL-C, consistent with Lp(a) promoting atherogenesis. However, the effects of Lp(a) may be greater for progression of plaque to obstructive disease than for the initial development of non-obstructive plaque. A limitation of this study is that Lp(a) was estimated using genetic markers and could not be directly assayed nor could apo(a) isoform size.This study assessed the association between genetic propensity towards higher lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] in the blood and the severity of coronary artery plaque seen on clinical angiograms, independent of other factors, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The study was conducted in a large US population using data from the Million Veteran Program. Genetically predicted high Lp(a) was associated with obstructive coronary plaque, but it was not associated with non-obstructive coronary plaque. This association was independent of LDL-C, and the association was greater for more severe forms of disease.The mechanisms of association between Lp(a) and cardiovascular events are debated. Prior studies have shown that Lp(a) does not associate with early markers of atherosclerosis. Our analyses support the idea that Lp(a) plays less of a role in early plaque initiation, but plays a significant role in the progression of plaque towards more severe disease, independent of LDL-C.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a circulating apolipoprotein B (ApoB) containing particle that has been observationally linked to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and is the target of emerging therapeutics. Recent work has highlighted the role of circulating lipoproteins in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). We sought to triangulate human observational and genetic evidence to evaluate the role of Lp(a) in AAA. Methods: We tested the association between circulating levels of Lp(a) and clinically diagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysms while controlling for traditional AAA risk factors and levels of ApoB using logistic regression among 795 individuals with and 374,772 individuals without AAA in the UK Biobank (UKB). Multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) was used to test for putatively causal associations between Lp(a) and AAA controlling for ApoB. Genetic instruments for Lp(a) and ApoB were created from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Lp(a) and ApoB comprising 335,796 and 418,505 UKB participants, respectively. The instruments were tested for association with AAA using data from a GWAS of 39,221 individuals with and 1,086,107 without AAA. Results: Elevated Lp(a) levels were observationally associated with an increased risk of AAA (OR 1.04 per 10 nmol/L Lp(a); 95\%CI 1.02-1.05; P{\textless}0.01). Clinically elevated Lp(a) levels ({\textgreater}150nmol/L) were likewise associated with an increased risk of AAA (OR 1.47; 95\% CI 1.15-1.88; P {\textless} 0.01) when compared to individuals with Lp(a) levels {\textless}150nmol/L. MVMR confirmed a significant, ApoB-independent association between increased Lp(a) and increased risk of AAA (OR 1.13 per SD increase in Lp(a); 95\%CI 1.02-1.24; P{\textless}0.02). Conclusion: Both observational and genetic analyses support an association between increased Lp(a) and AAA risk that is independent of ApoB. These findings suggest that Lp(a) may be a therapeutic target for AAA and drive the inclusion of AAA as an outcome in clinical trials of Lp(a) antagonists.},

It is not designed to jointly model multiple outcomes, as would be necessary to detect causes of more than one outcome and would be relevant to model multimorbidity or other related disease outcomes. Here, we introduce multi-response Mendelian randomization (MR2), an MR method specifically designed for multiple outcomes to identify exposures that cause more than one outcome or, conversely, exposures that exert their effect on distinct responses. MR2 uses a sparse Bayesian Gaussian copula regression framework to detect causal effects while estimating the residual correlation between summary-level outcomes, i.e., the correlation that cannot be explained by the exposures, and vice versa. We show both theoretically and in a comprehensive simulation study how unmeasured shared pleiotropy induces residual correlation between outcomes irrespective of sample overlap. We also reveal how non-genetic factors that affect more than one outcome contribute to their correlation. We demonstrate that by accounting for residual correlation, MR2 has higher power to detect shared exposures causing more than one outcome. It also provides more accurate causal effect estimates than existing methods that ignore the dependence between related responses. Finally, we illustrate how MR2 detects shared and distinct causal exposures for five cardiovascular diseases in two applications considering cardiometabolic and lipidomic exposures and uncovers residual correlation between summary-level outcomes reflecting known relationships between cardiovascular diseases.},

	doi = {10.1161/CIRCGEN.123.004512},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ascending thoracic aortic dilation is a complex heritable trait that involves modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors. Polygenic scores (PGS) are increasingly used to assess risk for complex diseases. The degree to which a PGS can improve aortic diameter prediction in diverse populations is unknown. Presently, we tested whether adding a PGS to clinical prediction algorithms improves performance in a diverse biobank.
METHODS: The analytic cohort comprised 6235 Penn Medicine Biobank participants with available echocardiography and clinical data linked to genome-wide genotype data. Linear regression models were used to integrate PGS weights derived from a genome-wide association study of thoracic aortic diameter performed in the UK Biobank and were compared with the performance of the previously published aorta optimized regression for thoracic aneurysm (AORTA) score.
RESULTS: Cohort participants had a median age of 61 years (IQR, 53-70) and a mean ascending aortic diameter of 3.36 cm (SD, 0.49). Fifty-five percent were male, and 33\% were genetically similar to African reference population. Compared with the AORTA score, which explained 30.6\% (95\% CI, 29.9\%-31.4\%) of the variance in aortic diameter, AORTA score+UK Biobank-derived PGS explained 33.1\%, (95\% CI, 32.3\%-33.8\%), the reweighted AORTA score explained 32.5\% (95\% CI, 31.8\%-33.2\%), and the reweighted AORTA score+UK Biobank-derived PGS explained 34.9\% (95\% CI, 34.2\%-35.6\%). When stratified by population, models including the UK Biobank-derived PGS consistently improved upon the clinical AORTA score among individuals genetically similar to European reference population but conferred minimal improvement among individuals genetically similar to African reference population. Comparable performance disparities were observed in models developed to discriminate cases/noncases of thoracic aortic dilation (≥4.0 cm).
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that inclusion of a UK Biobank-derived PGS to the AORTA score confers a clinically meaningful improvement in model performance only among individuals genetically similar to European reference population and may exacerbate existing health care disparities.},

Whether existing scores provide similar individual-level assessments of disease susceptibility remains incompletely characterized.To characterize the individual-level agreement of CHD PRSs that perform similarly at the population level.Cross-sectional study of participants from diverse backgrounds enrolled in the All of Us Research Program (AOU), Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB), and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) ATLAS Precision Health Biobank with electronic health record and genotyping data.Polygenic risk for CHD from published PRSs and new PRSs developed separately from testing samples.PRSs that performed population-level prediction similarly were identified by comparing calibration and discrimination of models of prevalent CHD. Individual-level agreement was tested with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Light κ.A total of 48 PRSs were calculated for 171 095 AOU participants. The mean (SD) age was 56.4 (16.8) years. A total of 104 947 participants (61.3\%) were female. A total of 35 590 participants (20.8\%) were most genetically similar to an African reference population, 29 801 (17.4\%) to an admixed American reference population, 100 493 (58.7\%) to a European reference population, and the remaining to Central/South Asian, East Asian, and Middle Eastern reference populations. There were 17 589 participants (10.3\%) with and 153 506 participants without (89.7\%) CHD. When included in a model of prevalent CHD, 46 scores had practically equivalent Brier scores and area under the receiver operator curves (region of practical equivalence ±0.02). Twenty percent of participants had at least 1 score in both the top and bottom 5\% of risk. Continuous agreement of individual predictions was poor (ICC, 0.373 [95\% CI, 0.372-0.375]). Light κ, used to evaluate consistency of risk assignment, did not exceed 0.56. Analysis among 41 193 PMBB and 53 092 ATLAS participants yielded different sets of equivalent scores, which also lacked individual-level agreement.CHD PRSs that performed similarly at the population level demonstrated highly variable individual-level estimates of risk. Recognizing that CHD PRSs may generate incongruent individual-level risk estimates, effective clinical implementation will require refined statistical methods to quantify uncertainty and new strategies to communicate this uncertainty to patients and clinicians.},

	abstract = {Background Smoking is a well-established risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). However, the molecular pathways underlying this relationship remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify circulating protein mediators that may explain the association between smoking and AAA.
Methods We conducted a network Mendelian randomization (MR) study utilizing summary-level data from the largest available genome-wide association studies. Our primary smoking exposure was the lifetime smoking index, with smoking initiation and cigarettes per day included as supplementary traits. The AAA dataset comprised 39,221 cases and 1,086,107 controls. Protein data were sourced from two large cohorts: UKB-PPP, where proteins were measured using the Olink platform in 54,219 individuals, and deCODE, where proteins were measured using the SomaScan platform in 35,559 individuals. Two-sample MR was employed to estimate the association between smoking and AAA (βtotal) and between smoking and circulating protein levels (β1). Summary data-based MR was then used to assess the association between smoking-related proteins and AAA risk (β2). Mediation pathways were identified based on the directionality of effect estimates, and the corresponding mediation effects were quantified.
Results Genetically predicted smoking traits were consistently associated with an increased risk of AAA. The lifetime smoking index was associated with the levels of 543 out of 5,764 unique circulating proteins, with 470 of these associations replicated in supplementary analyses using additional smoking traits and protein sources. Among the smoking-related proteins, genetically predicted levels of 22 were associated with AAA risk. Eight mediation pathways were identified accounting for 42.7\% of the total smoking-AAA association and with mediation effects {\textgreater}4\% for ADAMTS15, IL1RN, MMP12, PGF, PCSK9, and UXS1.
Conclusion This study identified numerous circulating proteins potentially causally linked to smoking, and eight of these proteins were found to mediate the association between smoking and AAA risk.},

	abstract = {Background: Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMVD) contributes to the large burden of ischemic heart disease, and there is a need for mechanistic insight and targeted therapies. Perfusion cardiac PET allows for the quantitative assessment of myocardial blood flow reserve (MBFR), which reflects coronary microvascular function. Here we perform the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) using cardiac PET MBFR as a measure of CMVD. Methods: MBFR was measured using Rubidium-82 cardiac perfusion PET obtained as part of routine clinical care. GWAS was performed using datasets from individuals genetically similar to EUR and AFR populations within the Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB), followed by comprehensive downstream analyses including fine-mapping and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). We used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to investigate associated molecular pathways and TIMI Frame Count to validate the association between the identified variants and CMVD. Finally, we assessed associations between key loci and proteins in the NF-κB pathway in the UK Biobank Pharma Proteome pGWAS dataset and with individual-level OLINK proteomic data in PMBB. Results: Among 241 targeted CAD loci, 17 in the AFR, 14 in the EUR, and 16 shared across both populations were significant (p{\textless}2e-04). A subsequent discovery GWAS identified 1 genome-wide significant association. Fine mapping identified a signal near ERC1. Sex-stratified TWAS identified CAPN2 in females and PLA2G5 in males. GSEA identified inflammatory and NF-κB pathways as the top pathways associated with these loci, and TIMI frame count confirmed that these loci were protective. Using proteomic data, we found IL-1B was increased in individuals with CAPN2 variant, and NEMO was differentially regulated by CAPN2 and ERC1 variants. Conclusions: Our study identified variants associated with MBFR in populations of EUR and AFR ancestry and converged on two independent loci that are near genes known to regulate the NF-κB pathway. Our multi-omic analyses support a role for NF-κB pathway in CMVD.},

We report a trans-ancestry genome-wide association meta-analysis of gallstone disease including 88,063 cases and 1,490,087 controls in the UK Biobank, FinnGen, Biobank Japan, and Million Veteran Program. We identified 91 (37 novel) risk loci across the meta-analysis and found replication in statistically compelling signals in the All of Us Research Program. A polygenic risk score constructed from trans-ancestry lead variants was positively associated with liver chemistry and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and negatively associated with total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels among trans-ancestry and European ancestry groups in the Penn Medicine BioBank. Cross-trait colocalization analysis between risk loci and 44 liver, metabolic, renal, and inflammatory traits yielded 350 significant colocalizations as well as 97 significant colocalizations and 65 prioritized genes from expression quantitative trait loci from eight tissues.

	abstract = {Heart failure is a complex trait, influenced by environmental and genetic factors, affecting over 30 million individuals worldwide. Here we report common-variant and rare-variant association studies of all-cause heart failure and examine how different classes of genetic variation impact its heritability. We identify 176 common-variant risk loci at genome-wide significance in 2,358,556 individuals and cluster these signals into five broad modules based on pleiotropic associations with anthropomorphic traits/obesity, blood pressure/renal function, atherosclerosis/lipids, immune activity and arrhythmias. In parallel, we uncover exome-wide significant associations for heart failure and rare predicted loss-of-function variants in TTN, MYBPC3, FLNC and BAG3 using exome sequencing of 376,334 individuals. We find that total burden heritability of rare coding variants is highly concentrated in a small set of Mendelian cardiomyopathy genes, while common-variant heritability is diffusely spread throughout the genome. Finally, we show that common-variant background modifies heart failure risk among carriers of rare pathogenic truncating variants in TTN. Together, these findings discern genetic links between dysregulated metabolism and heart failure and highlight a polygenic component to heart failure not captured by current clinical genetic testing. Common-variant and rare-variant association analyses combining datasets from multiple populations yield insights into the genetic architecture of all-cause heart failure across the allele-frequency spectrum.},

	abstract = {Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major contributor to cardiovascular morbidity (including myocardial infarction [MI] and heart failure [HF]), and mortality. Although the burden of CAD (number and degree of coronary artery stenosis) has been observationally linked to these outcomes, the causal contribution and independence from traditional cardiovascular risk factors has been poorly defined. Using publicly available genome wide association study (GWAS) data and individual level outcomes data from the Penn Medicine Biobank, we investigated whether angiographic CAD burden contributes to adverse cardiovascular outcomes independent of traditional risk factors. We developed and validated a polygenic risk score (PRS) for angiographic CAD burden, demonstrating that increasing levels of the PRS were strongly associated with increased prevalence of non-obstructive and obstructive CAD on coronary angiography, and was associated with other forms of cardiometabolic disease including peripheral artery disease and atherosclerotic risk factors including hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. Through Mendelian randomization analyses, we found that lipid measures (ApoB, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides) and type 2 diabetes significantly influenced myocardial infarction risk through their effects on angiographic CAD burden. Furthermore, LDL and total cholesterol demonstrated significant indirect effects on heart failure through angiographic CAD burden, suggesting these lipids primarily influence heart failure through their impact on coronary atherosclerosis. Our findings indicate that angiographic burden of coronary atherosclerosis mediates a substantial proportion of the relationship between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and adverse outcomes. These results support prioritizing primary prevention efforts targeting modifiable risk factors to prevent development and progression of coronary plaques before clinical disease manifestation.},
