	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) require timely follow-up by cardiac specialists and aortic valve replacement (AVR). This multicenter study evaluates how the specialty of the provider who ordered the initial echocardiogram influences these endpoints.
METHODS: Patients from 3 health systems with a first echocardiogram (index echo) diagnosing severe AS from Jan 1, 2019 to Dec 31, 2022, were categorized based on the specialty of the provider ordering the echo. Endpoints included a composite outcome of early cardiac follow-up or AVR (within 90 days), AVR during follow-up, and mortality. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify factors associated with the endpoints.
RESULTS: 4,249 patients (77 years; 58\% male; 88\% white; 72\% symptomatic AS) were followed for a median of 552 days. Eighty-nine percent of patients achieved the composite outcome, yet 1,801 patients (42\%) did not receive an AVR during the follow-up period, including 32\% of symptomatic patients. Patients referred for the index echo by noncardiac specialty providers had lower rates of early cardiac follow-up or AVR (adjusted OR: 0.33, 95\% CI, 0.25-0.43), lower AVR rates (adjusted HR: 0.59, 95\% CI, 0.53-0.66), and higher mortality (adjusted HR: 1.65; 95\% CI, 1.44-1.90) compared to the patients referred by a cardiology provider; the discrepancy was more pronounced in patients with low-flow, low-gradient AS.
CONCLUSION: In this large multicenter study of patients with severe AS, patients with a noncardiac specialty provider were less likely to receive timely cardiac follow-up and AVR, and had higher mortality. Initiatives to address disparities in care and improve outcomes for this high-risk population are needed.},

Among 5176 participants contacted by unsolicited email (3909 opt-in, 1267 opt-out), enrollment fraction was 1.0\% in the opt-in arm (n = 39) versus 3.6\% in the opt-out arm (n = 45) (OR 3.65, 95\% CI 2.37-5.64); there were no significant differences between opt-in and opt-out participants in the rate of completion of trial protocol steps.

	abstract = {Objective
The prevalence of moderate to severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis (i.e., atherosclerotic narrowing of the extracranial carotid arteries) is generally ∼6\% and ∼2\%, respectively. Most prior studies of carotid stenosis risk factors have been small. This study describes the development and validation of a natural language processing (NLP) tool to identify carotid stenosis and uses it to identify significant risk factors, presence, and severity of carotid stenosis.
Methods
We created an NLP tool to extract the ratio of peak systolic velocity of the internal carotid artery to the common carotid artery (ICA/CCA ratio) in Veterans receiving carotid duplex ultrasounds in the VHA from 2001 to 2020. Among those who had at least one valid ICA/CCA ratio, we identified carotid stenosis severity ({\textless}50\%, 50-69\%, ≥70\%) based on ICA/CCA ratio ({\textless}2, ≥2 to {\textless}4, ≥4) and assessed the association between presence and severity of carotid stenosis and clinical and demographic characteristics, including age, sex, self-identified race and ethnicity, smoking status, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, indicator variables for pre-existing hypertension, coronary heart disease, and type 2 diabetes, and selected laboratory measures (i.e., hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-c], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-c], triglyceride, and creatinine).
Results
The harmonic F1 score of the NLP tool was 0.907 for right value, 0.882 for left value, and 0.920 for max value. Among the 290,517 Veterans in the cohort, the median age was 68.2 years. Black patients had 16\% decreased risk of more severe carotid stenosis (OR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.81–0.87, p{\textless}0.001). All patient-level risk factors except high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly associated with carotid stenosis severity.
Conclusions
The NLP tool performed well, and the study performed with our NLP-created cohort largely validates the risk factors identified by previous smaller studies, demonstrating the utility of big data and NLP in carotid stenosis research.},

	abstract = {Cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are long-term complications of chronic liver disease (CLD). In this large multi-ancestry genome-wide association study of all-cause cirrhosis (35,481 cases, 2.36M controls) and HCC (6,680 cases, 1.76M controls), we identified 27 loci associated with cirrhosis (10 novel) and 11 with HCC (three novel). Three novel cirrhosis loci were replicated in independent cohorts (e.g. FGF21, RPTOR, and IFNL3/4). Fifteen cirrhosis loci exhibited differential effects on cirrhosis risk via underlying etiologies, and six HCC loci influenced HCC risk indirectly via cirrhosis. In a gene-burden analysis of rare variants from whole-genome sequencing data in the VA Million Veteran Program (n=102,677), we identified GSTA5 as a novel cirrhosis-associated gene, while APOB and ATP9B were associated with and replicated for HCC. A high genetic risk score for cirrhosis was associated with a nearly doubled risk of CLD progressing to cirrhosis (HR=1.94, P=2x10-68) and of cirrhosis progressing to HCC (HR=1.65, P=7x10-08). Finally, among individuals with chronic hepatitis C who underwent antiviral therapy, cirrhosis risk was modified by variants in PNPLA3, IFNL3/4, and CD81 following pegylated interferon-α therapy, and by APOE lead variant following direct-acting antiviral therapy. These findings provide new insights into the complex genetic architecture of CLD progression with potential clinical and therapeutic implications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Smoking is a well-established risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). However, the molecular pathways underlying this relationship remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify circulating protein mediators that may explain the association between smoking and AAA.METHODS:We conducted a network Mendelian randomization study using summary-level data from the largest available genome-wide association studies. Our primary smoking exposure was the lifetime smoking index, with smoking initiation and cigarettes per day included as supplementary traits. The AAA data set comprised 39 221 cases and 1 086 107 controls. Protein data were sourced from 2 large cohorts: UKB-PPP (the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project), where proteins were measured using the Olink platform in 54 219 individuals, and deCODE, where proteins were measured using the SomaScan platform in 35 559 individuals. Two-sample Mendelian randomization was used to estimate the association between smoking and AAA (βtotal) and between smoking and circulating protein levels (β1). Summary data-based Mendelian randomization was then used to assess the association between smoking-related proteins and AAA risk (β2). Mediation pathways were identified based on the directionality of effect estimates, and the corresponding mediation effects were quantified.RESULTS:Genetically proxied smoking traits were consistently associated with an increased risk of AAA. The lifetime smoking index was associated with the levels of 543 out of 5764 unique circulating proteins, with 470 of these associations replicated in supplementary analyses using additional smoking traits and protein sources. Among the smoking-related proteins, genetically proxied levels of 22 were associated with AAA risk. Eight mediation pathways were identified, with ADAMTS15 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 15), IL1RN (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein), MMP12 (matrix metalloproteinases 12), PGF (placental growth factor), PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), and UXS1 (UDP–glucuronic acid decarboxylase 1) representing key mediators.CONCLUSIONS:This study identified numerous circulating proteins that are potentially causally linked to smoking, and 8 of these proteins were found to mediate the association between smoking and AAA risk.},
