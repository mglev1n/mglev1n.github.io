In a study within a trial (SWAT) of an RCT testing a physical activity intervention in patients with peripheral artery disease, eligible patients were randomized to receive an email with an invitation to join the study and a link to the trial’s online platform (“opt-in”) or to receive an email framing participation as part of the standard of care followed by telephone outreach from a study coordinator (“opt-out”). Among 5176 participants contacted by unsolicited email (3909 opt-in, 1267 opt-out), enrollment fraction was 1.0\% in the opt-in arm (n = 39) versus 3.6\% in the opt-out arm (n = 45) (OR 3.65, 95\% CI 2.37-5.64); there were no significant differences between opt-in and opt-out participants in the rate of completion of trial protocol steps.

	abstract = {Objective
The prevalence of moderate to severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis (i.e., atherosclerotic narrowing of the extracranial carotid arteries) is generally ∼6\% and ∼2\%, respectively. Most prior studies of carotid stenosis risk factors have been small. This study describes the development and validation of a natural language processing (NLP) tool to identify carotid stenosis and uses it to identify significant risk factors, presence, and severity of carotid stenosis.
Methods
We created an NLP tool to extract the ratio of peak systolic velocity of the internal carotid artery to the common carotid artery (ICA/CCA ratio) in Veterans receiving carotid duplex ultrasounds in the VHA from 2001 to 2020. Among those who had at least one valid ICA/CCA ratio, we identified carotid stenosis severity ({\textless}50\%, 50-69\%, ≥70\%) based on ICA/CCA ratio ({\textless}2, ≥2 to {\textless}4, ≥4) and assessed the association between presence and severity of carotid stenosis and clinical and demographic characteristics, including age, sex, self-identified race and ethnicity, smoking status, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, indicator variables for pre-existing hypertension, coronary heart disease, and type 2 diabetes, and selected laboratory measures (i.e., hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-c], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-c], triglyceride, and creatinine).
Results
The harmonic F1 score of the NLP tool was 0.907 for right value, 0.882 for left value, and 0.920 for max value. Among the 290,517 Veterans in the cohort, the median age was 68.2 years. Black patients had 16\% decreased risk of more severe carotid stenosis (OR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.81–0.87, p{\textless}0.001). All patient-level risk factors except high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly associated with carotid stenosis severity.
Conclusions
The NLP tool performed well, and the study performed with our NLP-created cohort largely validates the risk factors identified by previous smaller studies, demonstrating the utility of big data and NLP in carotid stenosis research.},

In this large multi-ancestry genome-wide association study of all-cause cirrhosis (35,481 cases, 2.36M controls) and HCC (6,680 cases, 1.76M controls), we identified 27 loci associated with cirrhosis (10 novel) and 11 with HCC (three novel). Three novel cirrhosis loci were replicated in independent cohorts (e.g. FGF21, RPTOR, and IFNL3/4). Fifteen cirrhosis loci exhibited differential effects on cirrhosis risk via underlying etiologies, and six HCC loci influenced HCC risk indirectly via cirrhosis. In a gene-burden analysis of rare variants from whole-genome sequencing data in the VA Million Veteran Program (n=102,677), we identified GSTA5 as a novel cirrhosis-associated gene, while APOB and ATP9B were associated with and replicated for HCC. A high genetic risk score for cirrhosis was associated with a nearly doubled risk of CLD progressing to cirrhosis (HR=1.94, P=2x10-68) and of cirrhosis progressing to HCC (HR=1.65, P=7x10-08). Finally, among individuals with chronic hepatitis C who underwent antiviral therapy, cirrhosis risk was modified by variants in PNPLA3, IFNL3/4, and CD81 following pegylated interferon-α therapy, and by APOE lead variant following direct-acting antiviral therapy. These findings provide new insights into the complex genetic architecture of CLD progression with potential clinical and therapeutic implications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) require timely follow-up by cardiac specialists and aortic valve replacement (AVR). This multicenter study evaluates how the specialty of the provider who ordered the initial echocardiogram influences these endpoints.
METHODS: Patients from 3 health systems with a first echocardiogram (index echo) diagnosing severe AS from Jan 1, 2019 to Dec 31, 2022, were categorized based on the specialty of the provider ordering the echo. Endpoints included a composite outcome of early cardiac follow-up or AVR (within 90 days), AVR during follow-up, and mortality. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify factors associated with the endpoints.
RESULTS: 4,249 patients (77 years; 58\% male; 88\% white; 72\% symptomatic AS) were followed for a median of 552 days. Eighty-nine percent of patients achieved the composite outcome, yet 1,801 patients (42\%) did not receive an AVR during the follow-up period, including 32\% of symptomatic patients. Patients referred for the index echo by noncardiac specialty providers had lower rates of early cardiac follow-up or AVR (adjusted OR: 0.33, 95\% CI, 0.25-0.43), lower AVR rates (adjusted HR: 0.59, 95\% CI, 0.53-0.66), and higher mortality (adjusted HR: 1.65; 95\% CI, 1.44-1.90) compared to the patients referred by a cardiology provider; the discrepancy was more pronounced in patients with low-flow, low-gradient AS.
CONCLUSION: In this large multicenter study of patients with severe AS, patients with a noncardiac specialty provider were less likely to receive timely cardiac follow-up and AVR, and had higher mortality. Initiatives to address disparities in care and improve outcomes for this high-risk population are needed.},

	abstract = {Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent (annual incidence of 1-2 per 1,000) and potentially life-threatening (case-fatality rate up to 10\%) disease. VTE is associated with serious short-term and long-term complications, including a recurrence rate approaching 20\% within five years. Anticoagulant therapy, the mainstay of VTE treatment, drastically reduces the risk of early VTE recurrence, but it exposes patients to a substantial risk of bleeding. We analysed the genomic architecture of VTE recurrence using data from 6,355 patients across eight cohorts (including 1,775 recurrences), enriched by subgroup analyses, according to sex and clinical manifestation of first VTE, which led to the identification of 28 molecular markers. Through genome-wide association studies, we identified one locus associated with VTE recurrence: GPR149/MME. Among all variants known to be associated with first VTE, KNG1 and FGG were associated with recurrence. Additionally, Mendelian Randomization analyses identified seven proteins as risk factors for recurrence: elevated plasma levels of coagulation factor XI, coagulation factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, BGAT and GOLM2; decreased levels of PCSK9 and pro-IL16. Subgroup analyses revealed 18 molecular determinants associated with VTE recurrence, with notable differences between subgroups. For example, the exonic variant SLC4A1 p.Glu40Lys was significantly associated in pulmonary embolism patients (Hazard Ratio (HR)=3.13, P=5.9×10-11) but showed no effect in deep vein thrombosis patients (HR=0.91, P=0.72). These findings emphasize the role of specific genetic loci and protein pathways in influencing VTE recurrence and provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets. Further research is needed to clarify the biological mechanisms driving these associations.},

This study aimed to identify circulating protein mediators that may explain the association between smoking and AAA.METHODS:We conducted a network Mendelian randomization study using summary-level data from the largest available genome-wide association studies. Our primary smoking exposure was the lifetime smoking index, with smoking initiation and cigarettes per day included as supplementary traits. The AAA data set comprised 39 221 cases and 1 086 107 controls. Protein data were sourced from 2 large cohorts: UKB-PPP (the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project), where proteins were measured using the Olink platform in 54 219 individuals, and deCODE, where proteins were measured using the SomaScan platform in 35 559 individuals. Two-sample Mendelian randomization was used to estimate the association between smoking and AAA (βtotal) and between smoking and circulating protein levels (β1). Summary data-based Mendelian randomization was then used to assess the association between smoking-related proteins and AAA risk (β2). Mediation pathways were identified based on the directionality of effect estimates, and the corresponding mediation effects were quantified.RESULTS:Genetically proxied smoking traits were consistently associated with an increased risk of AAA. The lifetime smoking index was associated with the levels of 543 out of 5764 unique circulating proteins, with 470 of these associations replicated in supplementary analyses using additional smoking traits and protein sources. Among the smoking-related proteins, genetically proxied levels of 22 were associated with AAA risk. Eight mediation pathways were identified, with ADAMTS15 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 15), IL1RN (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein), MMP12 (matrix metalloproteinases 12), PGF (placental growth factor), PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), and UXS1 (UDP–glucuronic acid decarboxylase 1) representing key mediators.CONCLUSIONS:This study identified numerous circulating proteins that are potentially causally linked to smoking, and 8 of these proteins were found to mediate the association between smoking and AAA risk.},

	abstract = {Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Current antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatments are prone to failure. Heritable blood and platelet traits contribute to stroke risk, but related mechanisms are not fully understood. Platelets bind to damaged endothelial walls to initiate thrombosis, but erythrocyte and leukocyte recruitment are involved in stroke pathogenesis. We aimed to identify causal blood-related cells and mechanisms that modulate stroke risk. By two sample Mendelian Randomization (MR), increased platelet count heightened stroke risk (Odds ratio [OR] 1.03 per 1 SD unit increase in platelet count, P=1x10-2). However, these effects were relatively weak and complicated by similar effects from erythrocyte and leukocyte traits. To ascertain key blood traits that influence stroke, we applied Bayesian Model Averaging (MR-BMA) and identified platelet count and mean platelet volume as key positive regulators for stroke risk. We validated an epidemiologic association between increased platelet count and higher stroke risk among a large patient cohort. Taken together, these findings indicate that platelet traits are the most critical risk factors for stroke, among analyzed blood cell traits. To deconvolute multiple underlying genetic mechanisms by which platelet traits impact stroke risk, we clustered platelet count variants using noise-augmented directional clustering (NAvMix). We identified 13 clusters, two of which were highly predictive for increased stroke risk (OR 1.27 per SD unit increase in platelet count, P{\textless}1x10-6). Pathway analyses on eQTLs linked to variants in these subclusters indicated enrichment for endothelial cell adhesion or platelet reactivity. Colocalization analysis of stroke and platelet count loci identified genes implicated in platelet reactivity (RIN3) and peroxisome biogenesis (PEX6/PEX29). These findings reflect complex mechanisms underlying platelet trait variation and reveal key pathways that influence stroke risk through multiple cell types and biological mechanisms, including platelet biology and endothelial cell adhesion. An approach combining novel MR methods with subclustering may be a viable method to ascertain causal mechanisms related to other closely related exposure traits.},

	abstract = {Background

Identifying novel molecular drivers of disease progression in heart failure (HF) is a high‐priority goal that may provide new therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes. The authors investigated the relationship between plasma proteins and adverse outcomes in HF and their putative causal role using Mendelian randomization.

Methods and Results

The authors measured 4776 plasma proteins among 1964 participants with HF with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction enrolled in PHFS (Penn Heart Failure Study). Assessed were the observational relationship between plasma proteins and (1) all‐cause death or (2) death or HF‐related hospital admission (DHFA). The authors replicated nominally significant associations in the Washington University HF registry (N=1080). Proteins significantly associated with outcomes were the subject of 2‐sample Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses. After correction for multiple testing, 243 and 126 proteins were found to be significantly associated with death and DHFA, respectively. These included small ubiquitin–like modifier 2 (standardized hazard ratio [sHR], 1.56; P{\textless}0.0001), growth differentiation factor‐15 (sHR, 1.68; P{\textless}0.0001) for death, A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs–like protein (sHR, 1.40; P{\textless}0.0001), and pulmonary‐associated surfactant protein C (sHR, 1.24; P{\textless}0.0001) for DHFA. In pathway analyses, top canonical pathways associated with death and DHFA included fibrotic, inflammatory, and coagulation pathways. Genomic analyses provided evidence of nominally significant associations between levels of 6 genetically predicted proteins with DHFA and 11 genetically predicted proteins with death.

Conclusions

This study implicates multiple novel proteins in HF and provides preliminary evidence of associations between genetically predicted plasma levels of 17 candidate proteins and the risk for adverse outcomes in human HF.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lipoprotein-related traits have been consistently identified as risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, largely on the basis of studies of coronary artery disease (CAD). The relative contributions of specific lipoproteins to the risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD) have not been well defined. We leveraged large-scale genetic association data to investigate the effects of circulating lipoprotein-related traits on PAD risk.
METHODS: Genome-wide association study summary statistics for circulating lipoprotein-related traits were used in the mendelian randomization bayesian model averaging framework to prioritize the most likely causal major lipoprotein and subfraction risk factors for PAD and CAD. Mendelian randomization was used to estimate the effect of apolipoprotein B (ApoB) lowering on PAD risk using gene regions proxying lipid-lowering drug targets. Genes relevant to prioritized lipoprotein subfractions were identified with transcriptome-wide association studies.
RESULTS: ApoB was identified as the most likely causal lipoprotein-related risk factor for both PAD (marginal inclusion probability, 0.86; P=0.003) and CAD (marginal inclusion probability, 0.92; P=0.005). Genetic proxies for ApoB-lowering medications were associated with reduced risk of both PAD (odds ratio,0.87 per 1-SD decrease in ApoB [95\% CI, 0.84-0.91]; P=9×10-10) and CAD (odds ratio,0.66 [95\% CI, 0.63-0.69]; P=4×10-73), with a stronger predicted effect of ApoB lowering on CAD (ratio of effects, 3.09 [95\% CI, 2.29-4.60]; P{\textless}1×10-6). Extra-small very-low-density lipoprotein particle concentration was identified as the most likely subfraction associated with PAD risk (marginal inclusion probability, 0.91; P=2.3×10-4), whereas large low-density lipoprotein particle concentration was the most likely subfraction associated with CAD risk (marginal inclusion probability, 0.95; P=0.011). Genes associated with extra-small very-low-density lipoprotein particle and large low-density lipoprotein particle concentration included canonical ApoB pathway components, although gene-specific effects were variable. Lipoprotein(a) was associated with increased risk of PAD independently of ApoB (odds ratio, 1.04 [95\% CI, 1.03-1.04]; P=1.0×10-33).
CONCLUSIONS: ApoB was prioritized as the major lipoprotein fraction causally responsible for both PAD and CAD risk. However, ApoB-lowering drug targets and ApoB-containing lipoprotein subfractions had diverse associations with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and distinct subfraction-associated genes suggest possible differences in the role of lipoproteins in the pathogenesis of PAD and CAD.},

	abstract = {Background: Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiovascular disorder, characterized by irregular electrical activity in the upper chambers of the heart. Both chronic cardiometabolic risk factors and genetics have been shown to contribute to the development of atrial fibrillation. Birthweight has also been associated with risk of atrial fibrillation. Methods: In the current study, we utilized a genetic approach to study the effect of birthweight on atrial fibrillation. We used 2-sample Mendelian randomization to consider the impact of birthweight on incident atrial fibrillation using summary data from the Early Growth Genetics Consortium GWAS of birthweight and a large biobank-based GWAS of atrial fibrillation. Results: Using the framework of 2-sample Mendelian randomization, we found that a 1-SD genetic elevation of birthweight was associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 1.27 [95\% CI, 1.14-1.41]; P=1×10-5) with sensitivity analyses demonstrating robustness of this result. Conclusions: Our findings clarify the directionality of the relationship between birthweight and atrial fibrillation, supporting the growing body of evidence that intrauterine growth has a lifelong impact on cardiovascular health.},

Aggressive blood pressure management in patients with known AF reduces overall arrhythmia burden, but it remains unclear whether hypertension is causative for AF. To address this question, this study explored the relationship between genetic predictors of blood pressure and risk of AF. We secondarily explored the relationship between genetically proxied use of antihypertensive drugs and risk of AF. Two-sample Mendelian randomization was performed using an inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis with weighted median Mendelian randomization and Egger intercept tests performed as sensitivity analyses. Summary statistics for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure were obtained from the International Consortium of Blood Pressure and the UK Biobank discovery analysis and AF from the 2018 Atrial Fibrillation Genetics Consortium multiethnic genome-wide association studies. Increases in genetically proxied systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or pulse pressure by 10 mm Hg were associated with increased odds of AF (systolic blood pressure: odds ratio [OR], 1.17 [95\% CI, 1.11–1.22];

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The risk of arterial diseases may be elevated among family members of individuals having multifocal fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). We sought to investigate the risk of arterial diseases in families of individuals with FMD.
METHODS: Family histories for 73 probands with FMD were obtained, which included an analysis of 463 total first-degree relatives focusing on FMD and related arterial disorders. A polygenic risk score for FMD (PRSFMD) was constructed from prior genome-wide association findings of 584 FMD cases and 7139 controls and evaluated for association with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in a cohort of 9693 AAA cases and 294 049 controls. A previously published PRSAAA was also assessed among the FMD cases and controls.
RESULTS: 9.3\% (43) of all first-degree relatives of probands were diagnosed with FMD, aneurysms, and dissections. Aneurysmal disease occurred in 60.5\% of affected relatives and 5.6\% of all relatives. Among 227 female first-degree relatives of probands, 4.8\% (11) had FMD, representing a relative risk (RR)FMD of 1.5 ([95\% CI, 0.75-2.8]; P=0.19) compared with the estimated population prevalence of 3.3\%, though not of statistical significance. 11\% (8 of 72) of FMD proband fathers had AAAs resulting in a RRAAA of 2.3 ([95\% CI, 1.12-4.6]; P=0.014) compared with population estimates. The PRSFMD was found to be associated with an AAA (odds ratio, 1.03 [95\% CI, 1.01-1.05]; P=2.6×10-3), and the PRSAAA was found to be associated with FMD (odds ratio, 1.53 [95\% CI, 1.2-1.9]; P=9.0×10-5) as well.
CONCLUSIONS: FMD and AAAs seem to be sex-dimorphic manifestations of a heritable arterial disease with a partially shared complex genetic architecture. Excess risk of having an AAA according to a family history of FMD may justify screening in family members of individuals having FMD.},

In this study, we performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis from 14 discovery cohorts and uncovered 141 independent associations, including 97 previously unreported loci. A polygenic risk score derived from meta-analysis explained AAA risk beyond clinical risk factors. Genes at AAA risk loci indicate involvement of lipid metabolism, vascular development and remodeling, extracellular matrix dysregulation and inflammation as key mechanisms in AAA pathogenesis. These genes also indicate overlap between the development of AAA and other monogenic aortopathies, particularly via transforming growth factor β signaling. Motivated by the strong evidence for the role of lipid metabolism in AAA, we used Mendelian randomization to establish the central role of nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol in AAA and identified the opportunity for repurposing of proprotein convertase, subtilisin/kexin-type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. This was supported by a study demonstrating that PCSK9 loss of function prevented the development of AAA in a preclinical mouse model.},

Replicated was sought in a case-control study of 28 123 PAD cases and 128 459 controls from the veterans affairs Million Veteran Program (MVP) and a cohort study of 452 028 individuals from the UK Biobank study (UKB).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:
              Hundreds of biomarkers for peripheral artery disease (PAD) have been reported in the literature; however, the observational nature of these studies limits causal inference due to the potential of reverse causality and residual confounding. We sought to evaluate the potential causal impact of putative PAD biomarkers identified in human observational studies through genetic causal inference methods.
            
            
              METHODS:
              Putative circulating PAD biomarkers were identified from human observational studies through a comprehensive literature search based on terms related to PAD using PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase. Genetic instruments were generated from publicly available genome-wide association studies of circulating biomarkers. Two-sample Mendelian randomization was used to test the association of genetically determined biomarker levels with PAD using summary statistics from a genome-wide association study of 31 307 individuals with and 211 753 individuals without PAD in the Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program and replicated in data from FinnGen comprised of 11 924 individuals with and 288 638 individuals without PAD.
            
            
              RESULTS:
              We identified 204 unique circulating biomarkers for PAD from the observational literature, of which 173 were genetically instrumented using genome-wide association study results. After accounting for multiple testing (false discovery rate, {\textless}0.05), 10 of 173 (5.8\%) biomarkers had significant associations with PAD. These 10 biomarkers represented categories including plasma lipoprotein regulation, lipid homeostasis, and protein-lipid complex remodeling. Observational literature highlighted different pathways including inflammatory response, negative regulation of multicellular organismal processes, and regulation of response to external stimuli.
            
            
              CONCLUSIONS:
              Integrating human observational studies and genetic causal inference highlights several key pathways in PAD pathophysiology. This work demonstrates that a substantial portion of biomarkers identified in observational studies are not well supported by human genetic evidence and emphasizes the importance of triangulating evidence to understand PAD pathophysiology. Although the identified biomarkers offer insights into atherosclerotic development in the lower limb, their specificity to PAD compared with more widespread atherosclerosis requires further study.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a circulating apolipoprotein B (ApoB) containing particle that has been observationally linked to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and is the target of emerging therapeutics. Recent work has highlighted the role of circulating lipoproteins in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). We sought to triangulate human observational and genetic evidence to evaluate the role of Lp(a) in AAA. Methods: We tested the association between circulating levels of Lp(a) and clinically diagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysms while controlling for traditional AAA risk factors and levels of ApoB using logistic regression among 795 individuals with and 374,772 individuals without AAA in the UK Biobank (UKB). Multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) was used to test for putatively causal associations between Lp(a) and AAA controlling for ApoB. Genetic instruments for Lp(a) and ApoB were created from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Lp(a) and ApoB comprising 335,796 and 418,505 UKB participants, respectively. The instruments were tested for association with AAA using data from a GWAS of 39,221 individuals with and 1,086,107 without AAA. Results: Elevated Lp(a) levels were observationally associated with an increased risk of AAA (OR 1.04 per 10 nmol/L Lp(a); 95\%CI 1.02-1.05; P{\textless}0.01). Clinically elevated Lp(a) levels ({\textgreater}150nmol/L) were likewise associated with an increased risk of AAA (OR 1.47; 95\% CI 1.15-1.88; P {\textless} 0.01) when compared to individuals with Lp(a) levels {\textless}150nmol/L. MVMR confirmed a significant, ApoB-independent association between increased Lp(a) and increased risk of AAA (OR 1.13 per SD increase in Lp(a); 95\%CI 1.02-1.24; P{\textless}0.02). Conclusion: Both observational and genetic analyses support an association between increased Lp(a) and AAA risk that is independent of ApoB. These findings suggest that Lp(a) may be a therapeutic target for AAA and drive the inclusion of AAA as an outcome in clinical trials of Lp(a) antagonists.},

Polygenic scores (PGS) are increasingly used to assess risk for complex diseases. The degree to which a PGS can improve aortic diameter prediction in diverse populations is unknown. Presently, we tested whether adding a PGS to clinical prediction algorithms improves performance in a diverse biobank.
METHODS: The analytic cohort comprised 6235 Penn Medicine Biobank participants with available echocardiography and clinical data linked to genome-wide genotype data. Linear regression models were used to integrate PGS weights derived from a genome-wide association study of thoracic aortic diameter performed in the UK Biobank and were compared with the performance of the previously published aorta optimized regression for thoracic aneurysm (AORTA) score.
RESULTS: Cohort participants had a median age of 61 years (IQR, 53-70) and a mean ascending aortic diameter of 3.36 cm (SD, 0.49). Fifty-five percent were male, and 33\% were genetically similar to African reference population. Compared with the AORTA score, which explained 30.6\% (95\% CI, 29.9\%-31.4\%) of the variance in aortic diameter, AORTA score+UK Biobank-derived PGS explained 33.1\%, (95\% CI, 32.3\%-33.8\%), the reweighted AORTA score explained 32.5\% (95\% CI, 31.8\%-33.2\%), and the reweighted AORTA score+UK Biobank-derived PGS explained 34.9\% (95\% CI, 34.2\%-35.6\%). When stratified by population, models including the UK Biobank-derived PGS consistently improved upon the clinical AORTA score among individuals genetically similar to European reference population but conferred minimal improvement among individuals genetically similar to African reference population. Comparable performance disparities were observed in models developed to discriminate cases/noncases of thoracic aortic dilation (≥4.0 cm).
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that inclusion of a UK Biobank-derived PGS to the AORTA score confers a clinically meaningful improvement in model performance only among individuals genetically similar to European reference population and may exacerbate existing health care disparities.},

Individual-level agreement was tested with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Light κ.A total of 48 PRSs were calculated for 171 095 AOU participants. The mean (SD) age was 56.4 (16.8) years. A total of 104 947 participants (61.3\%) were female. A total of 35 590 participants (20.8\%) were most genetically similar to an African reference population, 29 801 (17.4\%) to an admixed American reference population, 100 493 (58.7\%) to a European reference population, and the remaining to Central/South Asian, East Asian, and Middle Eastern reference populations. There were 17 589 participants (10.3\%) with and 153 506 participants without (89.7\%) CHD. When included in a model of prevalent CHD, 46 scores had practically equivalent Brier scores and area under the receiver operator curves (region of practical equivalence ±0.02). Twenty percent of participants had at least 1 score in both the top and bottom 5\% of risk. Continuous agreement of individual predictions was poor (ICC, 0.373 [95\% CI, 0.372-0.375]). Light κ, used to evaluate consistency of risk assignment, did not exceed 0.56. Analysis among 41 193 PMBB and 53 092 ATLAS participants yielded different sets of equivalent scores, which also lacked individual-level agreement.CHD PRSs that performed similarly at the population level demonstrated highly variable individual-level estimates of risk. Recognizing that CHD PRSs may generate incongruent individual-level risk estimates, effective clinical implementation will require refined statistical methods to quantify uncertainty and new strategies to communicate this uncertainty to patients and clinicians.},

	abstract = {Heart failure is a complex trait, influenced by environmental and genetic factors, affecting over 30 million individuals worldwide. Here we report common-variant and rare-variant association studies of all-cause heart failure and examine how different classes of genetic variation impact its heritability. We identify 176 common-variant risk loci at genome-wide significance in 2,358,556 individuals and cluster these signals into five broad modules based on pleiotropic associations with anthropomorphic traits/obesity, blood pressure/renal function, atherosclerosis/lipids, immune activity and arrhythmias. In parallel, we uncover exome-wide significant associations for heart failure and rare predicted loss-of-function variants in TTN, MYBPC3, FLNC and BAG3 using exome sequencing of 376,334 individuals. We find that total burden heritability of rare coding variants is highly concentrated in a small set of Mendelian cardiomyopathy genes, while common-variant heritability is diffusely spread throughout the genome. Finally, we show that common-variant background modifies heart failure risk among carriers of rare pathogenic truncating variants in TTN. Together, these findings discern genetic links between dysregulated metabolism and heart failure and highlight a polygenic component to heart failure not captured by current clinical genetic testing. Common-variant and rare-variant association analyses combining datasets from multiple populations yield insights into the genetic architecture of all-cause heart failure across the allele-frequency spectrum.},

	abstract = {Background
The American Heart Association’s Predicting Risk of cardiovascular Events (PREVENT) aims to improve cardiovascular risk prediction. Whether PREVENT suitably predicts 10-year incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in health care populations is unknown.
Objectives
This study sought to evaluate the calibration and discrimination of the PREVENT equations across integrated U.S. health care systems.
Methods
We retrospectively evaluated electronic health records of 270,320 patients (Mass General Brigham [MGB]: 136,654; Mount Sinai Health: 43,321; Penn Medicine: 56,889; Vanderbilt University Medical Center: 33,456) aged 30 to 79 years and without prior ASCVD from 2010 to 2014. We compared 10-year estimated ASCVD risk based on PREVENT and empirically observed first ASCVD event over a 10-year follow-up. Calibration was assessed based on Greenwood-Nam-d’Agostino test, discordance, and mean calibration. Discrimination was assessed with the use of the time-dependent Harrell’s C-index.
Results
Based on PREVENT, the mean estimated 10-year ASCVD risk was 4.9\% ± 4.7\% in MGB (mean age 54 years, 42\% female), 6.0\% ± 5.6\% in Mount Sinai (mean age 56 years, 54\% female), 6.0\% ± 5.2\% in Penn (mean age 58 years, 55\% female), and 4.8\% ± 1.3\% in Vanderbilt (mean age 60 years, 51\% female). Although PREVENT underestimated the observed incidence rate in MGB (discordance: −71.0\%), Mount Sinai (discordance: −36.2\%), and Vanderbilt (discordance: −40.0\%), it more closely mirrored the empirical rate in Penn (+1.3\%). Overall, PREVENT yielded moderate discrimination C-index in MGB (0.70 [95\% CI: 0.70-0.70]), Mount Sinai (0.74 [95\% CI: 0.73-0.75]), Penn (0.69 [95\% CI: 0.68-0.70]), and Vanderbilt (0.73 [95\% CI: 0.72-0.74]). Nevertheless, calibration differed by sex, with greater underestimation among women in MGB (discordance: −80.7\%) and Vanderbilt (discordance: −55.5\%) but among men in Mount Sinai (discordance: −40.7\%). The race and ethnicity–stratified predictive performance varied across health care systems. Compared with the pooled cohort equations, PREVENT demonstrated better overall calibration in Penn (+2.5\% vs +93.6\%) but worse in MGB (−70.0\% vs −41.6\%) and Mount Sinai (−36.4\% vs 4.8\%), notwithstanding comparable discrimination. The PREVENT predictive performance further differed with better discrimination among patients without diabetes mellitus or antihypertensives.
Conclusions
The PREVENT model moderately discriminated ASCVD incidence across 4 geographically distinct academic health care systems in the United States. However, calibration metrics varied widely across health care systems, sociodemographics, and underlying cardiometabolic comorbidities.},

	abstract = {Objective
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common and life-threatening vascular disease. Genetic studies have identified numerous risk loci, many potentially encoding plasma proteins. However, the causal effects of plasma proteins on AAAs have not been thoroughly studied. We used genetic causal inference approaches to identify plasma proteins that have a potential causal impact on AAAs.
Methods
Causal inference was performed using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). For AAAs, we utilized recently published summary statistics from a multi-population genome-wide association meta-analysis including 39,221 individuals with and 1,086,107 individuals without AAAs from 14 cohorts. We used protein quantitative trait loci (protein quantitative trait loci) identified in two large-scale plasma-proteomics studies (deCODE and UKB-PPP) to generate genetic instruments. We tested 2783 plasma proteins for possible causal effects on AAAs using two-sample MR with inverse variance weighting with common sensitivity analyses.
Results
MR identified 90 plasma proteins associated with AAAs at a false discovery rate {\textless}0.05, with 25 supported by colocalization analysis. Among those supported by both MR and colocalization were proteins such as PCSK9 (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.4; P {\textless} 1e-10), LTBP4 (OR, 3.4; 95\% CI, 2.6-4.6; P {\textless} 1e-10), and COL6A3 (OR, 0.6; 95\% CI, 0.5-0.7; P {\textless} 1e-6). Gene Ontology analysis revealed enrichment of proteins (extracellular matrix; OR, 7.8; P {\textless} 1e-4), some with maximal mRNA levels in aortic tissue. Bi-directional MR suggested plasma level changes were not caused by liability to AAA itself. Colocalization analysis showed that an aortic expression quantitative trait locus for COL6A3, and a splicing quantitative trait locus for LTBP4 colocalized with their respective plasma pQTLs and AAA signals.
Conclusions
Our results highlight proteins and pathways with potential causal effects on AAAs, providing a foundation for future functional experiments. These findings suggest a possible causal pathway whereby genetic variation affecting extracellular matrix proteins expressed in the aortic wall cause their levels to change in blood plasma, influencing development of AAAs.},

	abstract = {Background Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart defect but often evades timely diagnosis due to variable clinical presentations. Prior to October 2024, no specific diagnosis code existed for BAV, limiting retrospective identification.
Objectives To develop and validate a natural language processing (NLP) system for automated extraction of heart valve morphology from echocardiographic reports, with focus on BAV detection.
Methods We developed a rule-based NLP system using MedSpaCy to analyze echocardiographic reports from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse. The system was trained on 555 manually annotated reports and validated on 170 held-out reports. Performance was measured using precision, recall, and F1-score for valve leaflet structure identification.
Results The NLP system achieved excellent performance for BAV detection with precision of 0.984, recall of 0.955, and F1-score of 0.969. When applied to 14,453,591 echocardiographic documents from 3,478,658 patients, the system identified 84,019 patients (2.42\%) with affirmed BAV. Among patients identified by the ICD-10 code Q23.81, NLP showed 86.1\% concordance, with manual review confirming NLP accuracy in discordant cases.
Conclusions This NLP approach enables large-scale retrospective identification of BAV patients from clinical text, creating the largest BAV cohort to date and facilitating future cardiovascular research and clinical decision-making.},

	abstract = {The effect of high percentage spliced in (hiPSI) TTN truncating variants (TTNtvs) on risk of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has historically been studied among population subgroups defined by genetic similarity to European reference populations. This has raised questions about the effect of TTNtvs in diverse populations, especially among individuals genetically similar to African reference populations. To determine the effect of TTNtvs on cardiovascular disease risk, we leveraged whole exome sequencing and electronic health record data from 43,731 Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB) participants recruited from across the Penn Medicine healthcare system. Fraction of genetic similarity to the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) African (AFR) reference population was determined using ADMIXTURE analysis. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association of hiPSI TTNtvs with prevalent DCM and atrial fibrillation (Afib), and linear regression was used to evaluate the association with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) either using dichotomized genetically similar population subgroup analysis or integrating ADMIXTURE population fraction. When individuals were assigned to population subgroups based on genetic similarity to the 1000G reference populations, hiPSI TTNtvs conferred significant risk of DCM among those genetically similar to the 1000G European (EUR) reference population (OR=6.12, 95\% confidence intervals [CI] 4.33 to 8.65, P {\textless} 0.001) and individuals genetically similar to the AFR reference population (OR=3.44, 95\% CI 1.97 to 5.99, P {\textless} 0.001). These results were consistent when considering the effect of change in fraction of similarity to the African reference population by ADMIXTURE as a continuous variable. Similar results were observed for the effect of TTNtvs on Afib and LVEF. Our findings demonstrate that TTNtvs are associated with increased risk of DCM, reduced LVEF, and Afib among a diverse cohort. There is no significant difference in effect of TTNtvs across fractions of similarity to the AFR reference population suggesting genetic background should not be considered when screening individuals for titin-related cardiovascular disease.},

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is an underdiagnosed cause of heart failure with a poor prognosis if left untreated. Echocardiography provides an excellent screening tool, but it is unknown how frequently patients with features consistent with CA undergo further testing.
Methods
The study aims to investigate the rates of cardiac MRI (CMR) and PYP scan utilization and identify the clinical and echocardiographic factors associated with their use. We performed a retrospective cohort study from December 2018 to September 2020. Patients age ≥ 18 years with echocardiographic features consistent with CA were included (moderate or greater concentric left ventricular hypertrophy plus moderate or severe diastolic dysfunction). We estimated multiple logistic regression models to identify factors associated with subsequent testing with CMR or PYP.
Results
Of 1015 patients, 83 patients (8.2 \%) underwent further testing. On multivariable analysis, factors associated with further testing include age 65+ years (aOR: 2.27; 95 \% CI: 1.31–3.96; p = 0.004), Black race (aOR: 1.76; 95 \% CI: 1.04–2.99; p = 0.036), diagnosis of HFrEF (aOR: 2.08; 95 \% CI: 1.04–4.17; p = 0.040), severe diastolic dysfunction (aOR: 2.14; 95 \% CI: 1.24–3.67; p = 0.006), severe wall thickness (aOR: 2.66; 95 \% CI: 1.52–4.66; p = 0.001), and echocardiogram ordered by a cardiologist (aOR: 1.95; 95 \% CI: 1.19–3.20; p = 0.009).
Conclusion
Among patients with echocardiographic features consistent with CA, follow-up testing remains low. Features consistent with advanced disease were associated with follow-up testing for CA, suggesting the need to implement strategies to better identify patients earlier in the disease process.},

	abstract = {Importance Polygenic background modifies variant penetrance in hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathy, diseases with opposing morphologic characteristics and inversely related genetic pathways. Whether polygenic susceptibility for one disease protects against monogenic risk for the other remains unexplored.
Objective To characterize if polygenic background bidirectionally modifies pathogenicity of established rare variants associated with HCM and DCM.
Design Cross-sectional study.
Setting The Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB).
Participants Volunteers enrolled in PMBB with available electronic health record and genotyping data.
Exposures Normalized polygenic scores (PGS) for HCM and DCM, as well as carrier status of pathogenic variants in established HCM or DCM genes.
Main Outcomes HCM and DCM defined using electronic health record diagnosis and procedure code, as well as echocardiogram measurements derived from medical records.
Results This study included 49,434 PMBB participants. An increased HCM PGS was associated with significantly increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), decreased left ventricular internal diameter at end-diastole (LVIDd), and increased interventricular septal thickness (IVS) (p{\textless}0.001). An increased DCM PGS was significantly (p{\textless}0.001) associated with decreased LVEF and increased LVIDd, but was not associated with IVS. A one standard deviation increase in HCM PGS was associated with increased risk of HCM (OR 1.8; 95\% CI 1.6-2.0; p=9.6x10-25) and decreased risk of DCM (OR 0.69; 95\% CI 0.64-0.74; p=4.3x10-22). A one standard deviation increase in DCM PGS was associated with an increased risk of DCM (OR 1.6; 95\% CI 1.5-1.7; p=1.7x10-40) and decreased risk of HCM (OR 0.69; 95\% CI 0.63-0.76; p=3.0x10-13). Monogenic and polygenic risk terms had significant, independent effects when combined in models of disease status and echocardiographic measurements; the additional inclusion of either an HCM or DCM PGS improved the discrimination of models of HCM and DCM that included age, sex, and monogenic variant status ({\textgreater}95\% probability of difference in AUROC).
Conclusions and Relevance HCM and DCM risk are markedly modified by polygenic background which exists on an overlapping spectrum. Consideration of polygenic background may offer clinical value through improving understanding and prediction of these inherited cardiomyopathies.
Question How is risk for hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy modified by polygenic background?Findings Polygenic scores for HCM and DCM associate with clinical and echocardiographic measures relevant to both diseases and inversely modify the penetrance of pathogenic variants.Meaning Polygenic background contributes to HCM and DCM susceptibility, and exists on an overlapping spectrum.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The genetic risk of intracranial aneurysm (IA) development has been ascribed to the genetic risk of smoking exposure and hypertension. The relationship of IA to other cardiovascular traits and the contribution of IA risk loci to aberrant gene programs within cerebrovascular cell types remains unclear.
METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study in the Million Veteran Program and Finnish cohort study testing association of roughly 25 million DNA variants with unruptured IA (4694 cases and 877 091 controls) in individuals of European, African, and Hispanic ancestries. Meta-analysis with publicly available summary statistics generated a final cohort of 15 438 cases and 1 183 973 controls. We constructed a cerebrovascular single-nuclear RNA sequencing data set and integrated IA summary statistics to prioritize candidate causal cell types. We constructed a polygenic risk score to identify patients at risk of developing IA.
RESULTS: We identified 5 novel associations with IA, increasing the number of known susceptibility loci to 22. At these susceptibility loci, we prioritized 17 candidate causal genes. We found a significant positive genetic correlation of IA with coronary artery disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm. Integration of an IA gene set with cerebrovascular single-nuclear RNA sequencing data revealed a significant association with pericytes and smooth muscle cells. Finally, a polygenic risk score was significantly associated with IA across European (odds ratio, 1.87 [95\% CI, 1.61-2.17]; P=8.8×10-17), African (odds ratio, 1.62 [95\% CI, 1.19-2.15]; P=1.2×10-3), and Hispanic (odds ratio, 2.28 [95\% CI, 1.47-3.38]; P=1.0×10-4) ancestries.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we identify 5 novel loci associated with IA. Integration of summary statistics with cerebrovascular single-nuclear RNA sequencing reveals an association of cell types involved in matrix production. We validated a polygenic risk score that predicts IA, controlling for demographic variables including smoking status and blood pressure. Our findings suggest that a deficit in matrix production may drive IA pathogenesis independent of hypertension and smoking.},

	abstract = {Background: Thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) can have catastrophic health consequences. Eleven genes have strong or definitive evidence for causing hereditary TAAD (HTAAD). However, patients are seldom tested for rare pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants in these HTAAD genes absent a strong family history, and little is known about either their prevalence in the general population or the associated TAAD risk. Furthermore, the degree to which common genetic variation associated with TAAD modifies rare variant pathogenicity is unknown. Methods: Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB) and MyCode participants volunteered to have electronic health records linked to biospecimen data including DNA which has undergone genome-wide genotyping and whole exome sequencing. P/LP HTAAD gene variants were adjudicated according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics standards, and logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the associated risk of TAAD. An ascending aortic diameter (AscAoD) polygenic risk score (PRS) was derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of aortic diameter to assess common variant TAAD risk, and regression analyses were performed to determine the modifying effect this PRS had on penetrance of rare variants. Results: Across the two analytic cohorts, 0.2-0.3\% of participants carried a P/LP HTAAD gene variant. Compared to individuals without a P/LP variant, carrying a P/LP HTAAD variant was associated with a 13.5-fold increased risk of a diagnosis of TAAD (95\% confidence interval [CI] 5.3 to 34.6, P{\textless}0.001) with variable effects when stratified by gene. A one standard deviation increase in the AscAoD PRS was associated with a 1.43-fold increased risk of TAAD (95\% CI 1.39 to 1.47, P{\textless}0.001). TAAD prevalence was higher among individuals carrying a P/LP HTAAD gene variant in the highest PRS quintile compared to carriers in the lowest PRS quintile (relative risk = 2.32, 95\% CI 1.29 to 4.17, P{\textless}0.01) suggesting that common variant risk may be an important modifier of rare variant risk for TAAD. Conclusions: Our results indicate that P/LP HTAAD gene variants confer a significant increased risk of TAAD in the population at-large, and that polygenic risk may be an important modifier of rare variant risk.},

This study assessed a risk model integrating PRS across populations, focusing on individuals with borderline/intermediate clinical risk. We developed ancestry-specific ensemble models combining multi-ancestry PRSs for CAD and type 2 diabetes. The cross-ancestry PRS (caPRS) was integrated with the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) to derive the cross-ancestry Integrated Risk Score (caIRS), estimating 10-year CAD risk. The caIRS outperformed the PCE across four cohorts, including UK Biobank and Penn Medicine Biobank, with significant improvements for Hispanic and South Asian individuals. For those at borderline/intermediate PCE risk (5–20\%), the caIRS reclassified between 7.0\% and 10.7\% into the high-risk group, which had higher CAD incidence and hazard ratios ranging from 3.20 to 3.84. The CAD caIRS, combining genetic and clinical factors, enhances high-risk CAD identification across diverse populations, potentially improving treatment guidance.},

Although prior studies suggest that many trait-associated loci are pleiotropic, the extent to which this pleiotropy reflects shared causal variants or confounding by linkage disequilibrium remains poorly characterized. To define a set of candidate loci with potentially pleiotropic associations, we performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses of up to 1,167 clinically relevant traits and diseases across 1,789,365 diverse individuals genetically similar to Admixed American (AMR, NMax = 60,756), African (AFR, NMax = 128,361), East Asian (EAS, NMax = 307,465), European (EUR, NMax = 1,283,907), and South Asian (SAS, NMax = 8,876) reference populations from the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP), UK Biobank (UKB), FinnGen, Biobank Japan (BBJ), Tohoku Medical Megabank (ToMMO), and Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES). We identified 27,193 genome-wide significant locus-trait pairs (1MB region with PGWAMA {\textless} 5 x 10-8) in within-population analysis and 29,139 in multi-population analysis (PMR-MEGA {\textless} 5 x 10-8). Among these, 11.5\% (n = 3,149) of locus-trait pairs in population-wise and 6.4\% (n = 1,875) in multi-population analyses did not reach genome-wide significance in previously published GWAS. In aggregate, the genome-wide significant loci fell within 2,624 non-overlapping autosomal genomic windows on average {\textasciitilde}600kb in size. Each locus contained genome-wide significant signals for a median of 6 traits (IQR 2 to 18), including 2,110 (80\%) pleiotropic loci associated with {\textgreater}1 trait. Multi-trait colocalization identified 1,902 (72\%) loci with high-confidence (posterior probability {\textgreater} 0.9) evidence of a shared causal variant across two or more traits. Variants in pleiotropic loci were significantly enriched for a broad spectrum of functional annotations compared to non-pleiotropic counterparts. Polygenic scores (PGS) developed from these data generally improved prediction compared to existing PGS and were broadly associated with both on- and off-target phenotypes. These results provide a contemporary map of genetic pleiotropy across the spectrum of human traits/diseases and genetic backgrounds.},

	abstract = {Transthyretin (TTR) is a hepatically derived tetrameric protein that is secreted into the circulation, where it is responsible for transporting hormones. In some individuals, due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors, this tetramer can degrade to form TTR fibrils. These insoluble, misfolded TTR fibrils are prone to aggregation in tissues. Ultimately, aggregation and deposition within the myocardium can result in TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), which is characterized by tissue dysfunction and fibrosis that can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and progressive conduction system disease. In patients with ATTR-CM, there are 2 primary mechanisms by which TTR can cause disease—the more common is due to misfolding of wild-type TTR, and the other occurs in patients who have pathogenic variants in the TTR gene that are predisposed to aggregation. Over the last several years, there have been novel therapies that modulate the expression and stabilization of TTR, which can modify disease progression for patients with neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. Questions remain regarding which patients should be treated with these medications and when in the clinical course the benefits of treatment outweigh potential adverse effects.},

Notably, the signal between PAD and LDL-C at the PCSK6 locus affects PCSK6 splicing in human liver tissue and induced pluripotent derived hepatocyte-like cells. These results show that joint analysis of related atherosclerotic disease traits and their risk factors allowed identification of unified biology that may offer the opportunity for therapeutic manipulation. The signal at PCSK6 represent possible shared causal biology where existing inhibitors may be able to be leveraged for novel therapies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pilonidal sinus disease is a highly morbid condition characterized by the formation of chronic sinus tracts throughout the sacrococcygeal region. Despite its commonality and strong association with family history, no prior investigation of genetic risk factors for pilonidal sinus disease exists.
OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic risk factors for pilonidal sinus disease.
DESIGN: A genome-wide association study.
SETTINGS: The United Kingdom Biobank, FinnGen Biobank, and Penn Medicine BioBank.
PATIENTS: There were 772,072 participants.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Genome-wide significant variants ( p {\textless} 5 × 10 -8 ) were mapped to genes using physical distance and gene expression in skin. Genetic correlation between pilonidal sinus disease and morphometric, androgen-driven, and hair phenotypes was estimated with linkage disequilibrium score regression. Finally, a genome-first approach to rare predicted deleterious variants in hair shaft genes TCHH , PADI3 , and TGM3 was conducted for association with pilonidal sinus disease via the Penn Medicine BioBank.
RESULTS: A genome-wide association study comprising 2835 individuals with pilonidal sinus disease identified 5 genome-wide significant loci, prioritizing HDAC9, TBX15, WARS2, RP11-293M10.1 , PRKAR1B , TWIST1, GPATCH2L, NEK9 , and EIF2B2 , as putative causal genes; several of these genes have known roles in balding and hair patterning. There was a significant correlation between the genetic background of pilonidal sinus disease and the androgen-driven hair traits of male pattern baldness and young age at first facial hair. In a candidate analysis of genes associated with syndromic hair disorders, rare coding variants in TCHH , a monogenic cause of uncombable hair syndrome, were associated with increased prevalence of pilonidal sinus disease (OR 4.81 [95\% CI, 2.06-11.2]).
LIMITATIONS: This study is limited to European ancestry. However, because there is a higher incidence of pilonidal sinus disease in men of European ancestry, this analysis is focused on the at-risk population.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic analysis of pilonidal sinus disease identified shared genetic architecture with hair biology and androgen-driven traits. As the first study investigating the genetic basis of pilonidal sinus disease, this provides biological insight into the long-appreciated connection between the disease state, male sex, and hair.

UN ESTUDIO DE ASOCIACIN DEL GENOMA COMPLETO IDENTIFICA GENES DEL CRECIMIENTO Y EL PATRN DEL PELO ASOCIADOS A LA ENFERMEDAD PILONIDAL: ANTECEDENTES:La enfermedad del seno pilonidal es una condición muy mórbida caracterizada por la formación de tractos sinusales crónicos en toda la región sacrococcígea. A pesar de su frecuencia y su fuerte asociación con los antecedentes familiares, no se han investigado previamente los factores de riesgo genéticos de la enfermedad sinusal pilonidal.OBJETIVO:Identificar factores genéticos de riesgo para la enfermedad del seno pilonidal.DISEÑO:Estudio de asociación de genoma completo.CONJUNTOS:Biobanco del Reino Unido, Biobanco FinnGen y Biobanco PennMedicine.PACIENTES:772.072 participantes.MEDIDA DE RESULTADO PRINCIPAL:Las variantes significativas en todo el genoma (p {\textless} 5x10-8) se asignaron a genes utilizando la distancia física y la expresión génica en la piel. La correlación genética entre la enfermedad del seno pilonidal y los fenotipos morfométricos, androgénicos y de cabello se estimó con regresión de puntuación LD. Por último, se realizó una aproximación genómica a variantes deletéreas raras predichas en los genes del tallo piloso TCHH, PADI3 y TGM3 para su asociación con la enfermedad del seno pilonidal a través del Biobanco PennMedicine.RESULTADOS:El estudio de asociación de todo el genoma, que incluyó a 2.835 individuos con enfermedad del seno pilonidal, identificó 5 loci significativos en todo el genoma, dando prioridad a HDAC9, TBX15, WARS2, RP11-293M10.1, PRKAR1B, TWIST1, GPATCH2L, NEK9 y EIF2B2, como genes causales putativos; varios de estos genes tienen funciones conocidas en la calvicie y el patrón del cabello. Se observó una correlación significativa entre los antecedentes genéticos de la enfermedad del seno pilonidal y los de los rasgos calvicie de patrón masculino y edad temprana del primer vello facial impulsados por andrógenos. En un análisis de genes candidatos asociados a trastornos capilares sindrómicos, las variantes raras de codificación en TCHH, una causa monogénica del síndrome capilar incombustible, se asociaron a una mayor prevalencia de la enfermedad del seno pilonidal (OR 4,81 [IC del 5\%, 2,06-11,2]).LIMITACIONES:Este estudio se limita a la ascendencia europea. Sin embargo, debido a que hay una mayor incidencia de la enfermedad sinusal pilonidal en los hombres de ascendencia europea, este análisis se centra en la población de riesgo.CONCLUSIÓN:El análisis genético de la enfermedad del seno pilonidal identificó una arquitectura genética compartida con la biología del cabello y los rasgos impulsados por andrógenos. Siendo el primer estudio que investiga las bases genéticas de la enfermedad del seno pilonidal, esto proporciona una visión biológica de la conexión, apreciada desde hace tiempo, entre el estado de la enfermedad, el sexo masculino y el cabello.

	abstract = {Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major contributor to cardiovascular morbidity (including myocardial infarction [MI] and heart failure [HF]), and mortality. Although the burden of CAD (number and degree of coronary artery stenosis) has been observationally linked to these outcomes, the causal contribution and independence from traditional cardiovascular risk factors has been poorly defined. Using publicly available genome wide association study (GWAS) data and individual level outcomes data from the Penn Medicine Biobank, we investigated whether angiographic CAD burden contributes to adverse cardiovascular outcomes independent of traditional risk factors. We developed and validated a polygenic risk score (PRS) for angiographic CAD burden, demonstrating that increasing levels of the PRS were strongly associated with increased prevalence of non-obstructive and obstructive CAD on coronary angiography, and was associated with other forms of cardiometabolic disease including peripheral artery disease and atherosclerotic risk factors including hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. Through Mendelian randomization analyses, we found that lipid measures (ApoB, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides) and type 2 diabetes significantly influenced myocardial infarction risk through their effects on angiographic CAD burden. Furthermore, LDL and total cholesterol demonstrated significant indirect effects on heart failure through angiographic CAD burden, suggesting these lipids primarily influence heart failure through their impact on coronary atherosclerosis. Our findings indicate that angiographic burden of coronary atherosclerosis mediates a substantial proportion of the relationship between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and adverse outcomes. These results support prioritizing primary prevention efforts targeting modifiable risk factors to prevent development and progression of coronary plaques before clinical disease manifestation.},

A diagnostic deep learning model trained on the synthetic dataset performed comparably to one trained on real data producing an AUROC=0.75(95\%CI 0.72-0.77), with similar performance on an internal dataset. Combining real data with positive samples from the synthetic data improved diagnostic accuracy producing an AUROC=0.80(95\%CI 0.78-0.82).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Supervised exercise therapy improves walking performance, functional capacity, and quality of life in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, few patients with PAD are enrolled in supervised exercise programs, and there are a number of logistical and financial barriers to their participation. A home-based walking intervention is likely to be more accessible to patients with PAD, but no fully home-based walking program has demonstrated efficacy. Concepts from behavioral economics have been used to design scalable interventions that increase daily physical activity in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease, but whether a similar program would be effective in patients with PAD is uncertain.
STUDY DESIGN AND OBJECTIVES: GAMEPAD (NCT04536012) is a pragmatic, virtual, randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a gamification strategy informed by concepts from behavioral economics to increase daily physical activity in patients with PAD who are seen in cardiology and vascular surgery clinics affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Patients are contacted by email or text message, and complete enrollment and informed consent on the Penn Way to Health online platform. A GAMEPAD substudy will evaluate the effectiveness of opt-in versus opt-out framing when approaching patients for study participation. Patients are then provided with a wearable fitness tracker, establish a baseline daily step count, set a goal to increase daily step count by 33\%-50\%, and are randomized 1:1 to the gamification or control arms. Interventions continue for 16 weeks, including a 4-week period during which goal step count is gradually increased in the gamification arm, with follow-up for an additional 8 weeks to evaluate the durability of behavior change. The trial has met its enrollment goal of 102 participants, with a primary endpoint of change from baseline in daily steps over the 16-week intervention period. Key secondary endpoints include change from baseline in daily steps over the 8-week postintervention follow-up period and changes in patient-reported measures of PAD symptoms and quality of life over the intervention and follow-up periods.
CONCLUSIONS: GAMEPAD is a virtual, pragmatic randomized clinical trial of a novel, fully home-based walking intervention informed by concepts from behavioral economics to increase physical activity and PAD-specific quality of life in patients with PAD. Its results will have important implications for the application of behavioral economic concepts to scalable home-based strategies to promote physical activity in patients with PAD and other disease processes where physical activity is limited by exertional symptoms.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is a complex, multifactorial disease associated with substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although it is frequently assessed using BMI, many epidemiological studies have shown links between body fat distribution and obesity-related outcomes. This study examined the relationships between body fat distribution and metabolic syndrome traits using Mendelian Randomization (MR).
METHODS/FINDINGS: Genetic variants associated with visceral adipose tissue (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT), and gluteofemoral adipose tissue (GFAT), as well as their relative ratios, were identified from a genome wide association study (GWAS) performed with the United Kingdom BioBank. GWAS summary statistics for traits and outcomes related to metabolic syndrome were obtained from the IEU Open GWAS Project. Two-sample MR and BMI-controlled multivariable MR (MVMR) were performed to examine relationships between each body fat measure and ratio with the outcomes. Increases in absolute GFAT were associated with a protective cardiometabolic profile, including lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol (β: -0.19, [95\% CI: -0.28, -0.10], p {\textless} 0.001), higher high density lipoprotein cholesterol (β: 0.23, [95\% CI: 0.03, 0.43], p = 0.025), lower triglycerides (β: -0.28, [95\% CI: -0.45, -0.10], p = 0.0021), and decreased systolic (β: -1.65, [95\% CI: -2.69, -0.61], p = 0.0019) and diastolic blood pressures (β: -0.95, [95\% CI: -1.65, -0.25], p = 0.0075). These relationships were largely maintained in BMI-controlled MVMR analyses. Decreases in relative GFAT were linked with a worse cardiometabolic profile, with higher levels of detrimental lipids and increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures.
CONCLUSION: A MR analysis of ASAT, GFAT, and VAT depots and their relative ratios with metabolic syndrome related traits and outcomes revealed that increased absolute and relative GFAT were associated with a favorable cardiometabolic profile independently of BMI. These associations highlight the importance of body fat distribution in obesity and more precise means to categorize obesity beyond BMI.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia worldwide. There is considerable interest in better understanding the molecular genetics and biology of atrial fibrillation to inform the development of new therapies and improve clinical management. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the genetic basis of atrial fibrillation and new efforts to utilize genetics to inform clinical management.
RECENT FINDINGS: Genome-wide association studies in diverse populations have increased the number of genetic loci associated with atrial fibrillation and its specific subtypes. Large-scale biobanks with deep phenotyping have provided invaluable data to study the impact of both common and rare variants on atrial fibrillation, susceptibility, and prognosis. Polygenic risk scores help improve individual atrial fibrillation risk stratification and prognostication.
SUMMARY: Our understanding of atrial fibrillation genetics is rapidly improving with larger and more diverse genome-wide association studies. Translating genetic discoveries into molecular pathways and new therapeutic targets remains a bottleneck in the development of new therapies for atrial fibrillation. Genetic risk scores have shown early promise in improving atrial fibrillation risk stratification; however, their broader utility for the general population remains unclear.},

	abstract = {Background:
              Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a life-threatening vascular event with environmental and genetic determinants. Recent VTE genome-wide association studies (GWAS) meta-analyses involved nearly 30 000 VTE cases and identified up to 40 genetic loci associated with VTE risk, including loci not previously suspected to play a role in hemostasis. The aim of our research was to expand discovery of new genetic loci associated with VTE by using cross-ancestry genomic resources.
            
            
              Methods:
              We present new cross-ancestry meta-analyzed GWAS results involving up to 81 669 VTE cases from 30 studies, with replication of novel loci in independent populations and loci characterization through in silico genomic interrogations.
            
            
              Results:
              In our genetic discovery effort that included 55 330 participants with VTE (47 822 European, 6320 African, and 1188 Hispanic ancestry), we identified 48 novel associations, of which 34 were replicated after correction for multiple testing. In our combined discovery-replication analysis (81 669 VTE participants) and ancestry-stratified meta-analyses (European, African, and Hispanic), we identified another 44 novel associations, which are new candidate VTE-associated loci requiring replication. In total, across all GWAS meta-analyses, we identified 135 independent genomic loci significantly associated with VTE risk. A genetic risk score of the significantly associated loci in Europeans identified a 6-fold increase in risk for those in the top 1\% of scores compared with those with average scores. We also identified 31 novel transcript associations in transcriptome-wide association studies and 8 novel candidate genes with protein quantitative-trait locus Mendelian randomization analyses. In silico interrogations of hemostasis and hematology traits and a large phenome-wide association analysis of the 135 GWAS loci provided insights to biological pathways contributing to VTE, with some loci contributing to VTE through well-characterized coagulation pathways and others providing new data on the role of hematology traits, particularly platelet function. Many of the replicated loci are outside of known or currently hypothesized pathways to thrombosis.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Our cross-ancestry GWAS meta-analyses identified new loci associated with VTE. These findings highlight new pathways to thrombosis and provide novel molecules that may be useful in the development of improved antithrombosis treatments.},

The ColocQuiaL pipeline provides a framework to perform these colocalization analyses at scale across the genome and returns summary files and locus visualization plots to allow for detailed review of the results. As an example, we used ColocQuiaL to perform colocalization between the latest type 2 diabetes GWAS data and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) v8 single-tissue eQTL and sQTL data.

	doi = {10.1093/hmg/ddab249},
	abstract = {'Genome-first' approaches to analyzing rare variants can reveal new insights into human biology and disease. Because pathogenic variants are often rare, new discovery requires aggregating rare coding variants into 'gene burdens' for sufficient power. However, a major challenge is deciding which variants to include in gene burden tests. Pathogenic variants in MYBPC3 and MYH7 are well-known causes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and focusing on these 'positive control' genes in a genome-first approach could help inform variant selection methods and gene burdening strategies for other genes and diseases. Integrating exome sequences with electronic health records among 41 759 participants in the Penn Medicine BioBank, we evaluated the performance of aggregating predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) and/or predicted deleterious missense (pDM) variants in MYBPC3 and MYH7 for gene burden phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). The approach to grouping rare variants for these two genes produced very different results: pLOFs but not pDM variants in MYBPC3 were strongly associated with HCM, whereas the opposite was true for MYH7. Detailed review of clinical charts revealed that only 38.5\% of patients with HCM diagnoses carrying an HCM-associated variant in MYBPC3 or MYH7 had a clinical genetic test result. Additionally, 26.7\% of MYBPC3 pLOF carriers without HCM diagnoses had clear evidence of left atrial enlargement and/or septal/LV hypertrophy on echocardiography. Our study shows the importance of evaluating both pLOF and pDM variants for gene burden testing in future studies to uncover novel gene-disease relationships and identify new pathogenic loss-of-function variants across the human genome through genome-first analyses of healthcare-based populations.},

	abstract = {Purpose: “Genome-first” approaches, in which genetic sequencing is agnostically linked to associated phenotypes, can enhance our understanding of rare variants’ contributions to disease. Loss-of-function variants in LMNA cause a range of rare diseases, including cardiomyopathy. Methods: We leveraged exome sequencing from 11,451 unselected individuals in the Penn Medicine Biobank to associate rare variants in LMNA with diverse electronic health record (EHR)–derived phenotypes. We used Rare Exome Variant Ensemble Learner (REVEL) to annotate rare missense variants, clustered predicted deleterious and loss-of-function variants into a “gene burden” (N = 72 individuals), and performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). Major findings were replicated in DiscovEHR. Results: The LMNA gene burden was significantly associated with primary cardiomyopathy (p = 1.78E-11) and cardiac conduction disorders (p = 5.27E-07). Most patients had not been clinically diagnosed with LMNA cardiomyopathy. We also noted an association with chronic kidney disease (p = 1.13E-06). Regression analyses on echocardiography and serum labs revealed that LMNA variant carriers had dilated cardiomyopathy and primary renal disease. Conclusion: Pathogenic LMNA variants are an underdiagnosed cause of cardiomyopathy. We also find that LMNA loss of function may be a primary cause of renal disease. Finally, we show the value of aggregating rare, annotated variants into a gene burden and using PheWAS to identify novel ontologies for pleiotropic human genes.},

	abstract = {Mitochondrial homeostasis depends on mitophagy, the programmed degradation of mitochondria. Only a few proteins are known to participate in mitophagy. Here we develop a multidimensional CRISPR–Cas9 genetic screen, using multiple mitophagy reporter systems and pro-mitophagy triggers, and identify numerous components of parkin-dependent mitophagy1. Unexpectedly, we find that the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) complex is required for mitophagy in several cell types. Whereas pharmacological inhibition of ANT-mediated ADP/ATP exchange promotes mitophagy, genetic ablation of ANT paradoxically suppresses mitophagy. Notably, ANT promotes mitophagy independently of its nucleotide translocase catalytic activity. Instead, the ANT complex is required for inhibition of the presequence translocase TIM23, which leads to stabilization of PINK1, in response to bioenergetic collapse. ANT modulates TIM23 indirectly via interaction with TIM44, which regulates peptide import through TIM232. Mice that lack ANT1 show blunted mitophagy and consequent profound accumulation of aberrant mitochondria. Disease-causing human mutations in ANT1 abrogate binding to TIM44 and TIM23 and inhibit mitophagy. Together, our findings show that ANT is an essential and fundamental mediator of mitophagy in health and disease.},

There have been conflicting reports as to whether an association exists between APOL1 risk alleles and cardiovascular disease (CVD) that is independent of the effects of APOL1 on kidney disease. We sought to test the association of APOL1 G1/G2 alleles with coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and stroke among black individuals in the Million Veteran Program. Methods: We performed a time-to-event analysis of retrospective electronic health record data using Cox proportional hazard and competing-risks Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard models. The primary exposure was APOL1 risk allele status. The primary outcome was incident coronary artery disease among individuals without chronic kidney disease during the 12.5-year follow-up period. We separately analyzed the cross-sectional association of APOL1 risk allele status with lipid traits and 115 cardiovascular diseases using phenome-wide association. Results: Among 30 903 black Million Veteran Program participants, 3941 (13\%) carried the 2 APOL1 risk allele high-risk genotype. Individuals with normal kidney function at baseline with 2 risk alleles had slightly higher risk of developing coronary artery disease compared with those with no risk alleles (hazard ratio, 1.11 [95\% CI, 1.01-1.21]; P=0.039). Similarly, modest associations were identified with incident stroke (hazard ratio, 1.20 [95\% CI, 1.05-1.36; P=0.007) and peripheral artery disease (hazard ratio, 1.15 [95\% CI, 1.01-1.29l; P=0.031). When both cardiovascular and renal outcomes were modeled, APOL1 was strongly associated with incident renal disease, whereas no significant association with the CVD end points could be detected. Cardiovascular phenome-wide association analyses did not identify additional significant associations with CVD subsets. Conclusions: APOL1 risk variants display a modest association with CVD, and this association is likely mediated by the known APOL1 association with chronic kidney disease.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate a wide variety of biological processes and contribute to metabolic homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that microRNA-223 (miR-223), an miRNA previously associated with inflammation, also controls multiple mechanisms associated with cholesterol metabolism. miR-223 promoter activity and mature levels were found to be linked to cellular cholesterol states in hepatoma cells. Moreover, hypercholesterolemia was associated with increased hepatic miR-223 levels in athero-prone mice. miR-223 was found to regulate high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) uptake, through direct targeting and repression of scavenger receptor BI, and to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis through the direct repression of sterol enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1 and methylsterol monooxygenase 1 in humans. Additionally, miR-223 was found to indirectly promote ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 expression (mRNA and protein) through Sp3, thereby enhancing cellular cholesterol efflux. Finally, genetic ablation of miR-223 in mice resulted in increased HDL-C levels and particle size, as well as increased hepatic and plasma total cholesterol levels. In summary, we identified a critical role for miR-223 in systemic cholesterol regulation by coordinated posttranscriptional control of multiple genes in lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism.},

	abstract = {Background: Truncating variants in the Titin gene (TTNtvs) are common in individuals with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, a comprehensive genomics-first evaluation of the impact of TTNtvs in different clinical contexts, and the evaluation of modifiers such as genetic ancestry, has not been performed. Methods: We reviewed whole exome sequence data for {\textgreater}71 000 individuals (61 040 from the Geisinger MyCode Community Health Initiative (2007 to present) and 10 273 from the PennMedicine BioBank (2013 to present) to identify anyone with TTNtvs. We further selected individuals with TTNtvs in exons highly expressed in the heart (proportion spliced in [PSI] {\textgreater}0.9). Using linked electronic health records, we evaluated associations of TTNtvs with diagnoses and quantitative echocardiographic measures, including subanalyses for individuals with and without DCM diagnoses. We also reviewed data from the Jackson Heart Study to validate specific analyses for individuals of African ancestry. Results: Identified with a TTNtv in a highly expressed exon (hiPSI) were 1.2\% individuals in PennMedicine BioBank and 0.6\% at Geisinger. The presence of a hiPSI TTNtv was associated with increased odds of DCM in individuals of European ancestry (odds ratio [95\% CI]: 18.7 [9.1-39.4] \{PennMedicine BioBank\} and 10.8 [7.0-16.0] \{Geisinger\}). hiPSI TTNtvs were not associated with DCM in individuals of African ancestry, despite a high DCM prevalence (odds ratio, 1.8 [0.2-13.7]; P=0.57). Among 244 individuals of European ancestry with DCM in PennMedicine BioBank, hiPSI TTNtv carriers had lower left ventricular ejection fraction (β=-12\%, P=3×10-7), and increased left ventricular diameter (β=0.65 cm, P=9×10-3). In the Geisinger cohort, hiPSI TTNtv carriers without a cardiomyopathy diagnosis had more atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 2.4 [1.6-3.6]) and heart failure (odds ratio, 3.8 [2.4-6.0]), and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (β=-3.4\%, P=1×10-7). Conclusions: Individuals of European ancestry with hiPSI TTNtv have an abnormal cardiac phenotype characterized by lower left ventricular ejection fraction, irrespective of the clinical manifestation of cardiomyopathy. Associations with arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, were observed even when controlling for cardiomyopathy diagnosis. In contrast, no association between hiPSI TTNtvs and DCM was discerned among individuals of African ancestry. Given these findings, clinical identification of hiPSI TTNtv carriers may alter clinical management strategies.},

	abstract = {Type 1 cannabinoid receptor blockers increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Although genetic variation in the type 1 cannabinoid receptor - encoded by the CNR1 gene - is known to influence high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level as well, human studies conducted to date have been limited to genetic markers such as haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms. Here we identify rs806371 in the CNR1 promoter as the causal variant. We re-sequence the CNR1 gene and genotype all variants in a DNA biobank linked to comprehensive electronic medical records. By testing each variant for association with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in a clinical practice-based setting, we localize a putative functional allele to a 100-bp window in the 5′-flanking region. Assessment of variants in this window for functional impact on electrophoretic mobility shift assay identifies rs806371 as a novel regulatory binding element. Reporter gene assays confirm that rs806371 reduces gene expression, thereby linking CNR1 gene variation to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in humans.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Clinical reasoning is a fundamental part of a physician's daily workflow. Yet it remains a challenging skill to develop formally, especially in preclerkship-level early learners. Traditionally, medical students learn clinical reasoning informally through experiential opportunities during their clerkship years. This occurs in contrast to the more structured, explicit learning of the basic sciences and physical diagnosis during the preclerkship years. To address this need, we present a flipped classroom case-based approach for developing clinical reasoning skills based on problem representation and the use of a structured illness script worksheet as a model. Methods: Students were given a short introduction via screencast to introduce clinical reasoning and related terminology such as problem representation and semantic qualifiers. They also received a case vignette and an illness script worksheet to prepare them for in-class discussion. Students used this worksheet to practice clinical reasoning in a small-group session that was held in our last organ system–based second-year course, prior to the start of the clerkships. Results: In comparison to the traditional facilitator-led small-group sessions, where students would sequentially answer a set of defined content-based questions to explore a clinical case, 80\% of students preferred the new framework that incorporates problem representation and the illness script worksheets. Faculty facilitators found the structure of the illness script worksheet helpful in leading a clinical reasoning small-group session. Discussion: Based on the results of this pilot, we plan to systematically implement this clinical reasoning framework in our preclerkship curriculum.},

	abstract = {Atherogenic dyslipidemia, characterized by increased triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs), increased small dense low density lipoprotein (LDL), and low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL), is common in obesity. This constellation is often accompanied by insulin resistance and associated with substantially increased risk for cardiovascular disease in these individuals. This chapter details the known molecular mechanisms of adipose tissue and hepatic function, as it pertains to apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly and metabolism, both in the healthy as well as in the obese, insulin resistant state. The mechanisms connecting obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia are incompletely understood, but are thought to be driven by (a) increased flux of free fatty acids (FFAs) from adipose tissue to liver driving hepatic overproduction of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), (b) impaired catabolism of atherogenic lipoprotein remnants, and (c) hypercatabolism of HDL. The pathophysiology of each of these, and the implications for cardiovascular disease risk and therapeutics are discussed. The present paradigm is likely oversimplified, and a more thorough understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms is critical for improving our approach to managing the influence of obesity on lipoprotein metabolism, and to the development of appropriate therapeutic approaches. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a predominant enzyme mediating triglyceride (TG) lipolysis and TRL clearance to provide fatty acids to tissues in animals. Physiological and human genetic evidence support a primary role for LPL in hydrolyzing TRL TGs. We hypothesized that endothelial lipase (EL), another extracellular lipase that primarily hydrolyzes lipoprotein phospholipids may also contribute to TRL metabolism. To explore this, we studied the impact of genetic EL loss-of-function on TRL metabolism in humans and mice. Humans carrying a loss-of-function missense variant in LIPG, p.Asn396Ser (rs77960347), demonstrated elevated plasma TGs and elevated phospholipids in TRLs, among other lipoprotein classes. Mice with germline EL deficiency challenged with excess dietary TG through refeeding or a high-fat diet exhibited elevated TGs, delayed dietary TRL clearance, and impaired TRL TG lipolysis in vivo that was rescued by EL reconstitution in the liver. Lipidomic analyses of postprandial plasma from high-fat fed Lipg-/- mice demonstrated accumulation of phospholipids and TGs harboring long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), known substrates for EL lipolysis. In vitro and in vivo, EL and LPL together promoted greater TG lipolysis than either extracellular lipase alone. Our data positions EL as a key collaborator of LPL to mediate efficient lipolysis of TRLs in humans and mice.},

Epidemiologic studies have highlighted smoking as an important driver of somatic mutations across multiple tissues. However, establishing the causal role of smoking in clonal hematopoiesis has been limited by observational study designs, which may suffer from confounding and reverse-causality. We performed two complementary analyses to investigate the role of smoking in mCAs and CHIP. First, using an observational study design among UK Biobank participants, we confirmed strong associations between smoking and mCAs. Second, using two-sample Mendelian randomization, smoking was strongly associated with mCA but not with CHIP. Overall, these results support a causal association between smoking and mCAs and suggest smoking may variably shape the fitness of clones bearing somatic mutations.},

	abstract = {Background: Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMVD) contributes to the large burden of ischemic heart disease, and there is a need for mechanistic insight and targeted therapies. Perfusion cardiac PET allows for the quantitative assessment of myocardial blood flow reserve (MBFR), which reflects coronary microvascular function. Here we perform the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) using cardiac PET MBFR as a measure of CMVD. Methods: MBFR was measured using Rubidium-82 cardiac perfusion PET obtained as part of routine clinical care. GWAS was performed using datasets from individuals genetically similar to EUR and AFR populations within the Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB), followed by comprehensive downstream analyses including fine-mapping and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). We used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to investigate associated molecular pathways and TIMI Frame Count to validate the association between the identified variants and CMVD. Finally, we assessed associations between key loci and proteins in the NF-κB pathway in the UK Biobank Pharma Proteome pGWAS dataset and with individual-level OLINK proteomic data in PMBB. Results: Among 241 targeted CAD loci, 17 in the AFR, 14 in the EUR, and 16 shared across both populations were significant (p{\textless}2e-04). A subsequent discovery GWAS identified 1 genome-wide significant association. Fine mapping identified a signal near ERC1. Sex-stratified TWAS identified CAPN2 in females and PLA2G5 in males. GSEA identified inflammatory and NF-κB pathways as the top pathways associated with these loci, and TIMI frame count confirmed that these loci were protective. Using proteomic data, we found IL-1B was increased in individuals with CAPN2 variant, and NEMO was differentially regulated by CAPN2 and ERC1 variants. Conclusions: Our study identified variants associated with MBFR in populations of EUR and AFR ancestry and converged on two independent loci that are near genes known to regulate the NF-κB pathway. Our multi-omic analyses support a role for NF-κB pathway in CMVD.},

It is not designed to jointly model multiple outcomes, as would be necessary to detect causes of more than one outcome and would be relevant to model multimorbidity or other related disease outcomes. Here, we introduce multi-response Mendelian randomization (MR2), an MR method specifically designed for multiple outcomes to identify exposures that cause more than one outcome or, conversely, exposures that exert their effect on distinct responses. MR2 uses a sparse Bayesian Gaussian copula regression framework to detect causal effects while estimating the residual correlation between summary-level outcomes, i.e., the correlation that cannot be explained by the exposures, and vice versa. We show both theoretically and in a comprehensive simulation study how unmeasured shared pleiotropy induces residual correlation between outcomes irrespective of sample overlap. We also reveal how non-genetic factors that affect more than one outcome contribute to their correlation. We demonstrate that by accounting for residual correlation, MR2 has higher power to detect shared exposures causing more than one outcome. It also provides more accurate causal effect estimates than existing methods that ignore the dependence between related responses. Finally, we illustrate how MR2 detects shared and distinct causal exposures for five cardiovascular diseases in two applications considering cardiometabolic and lipidomic exposures and uncovers residual correlation between summary-level outcomes reflecting known relationships between cardiovascular diseases.},

	abstract = {Elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms of risk are debated. Studies have found inconsistent associations between Lp(a) and measurements of atherosclerosis. We aimed to assess the relationship between Lp(a), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and coronary artery plaque severity.The study population consisted of participants of the Million Veteran Program who have undergone an invasive angiogram. The primary exposure was genetically predicted Lp(a) estimated by a polygenic score. Genetically predicted LDL-C was also assessed for comparison. The primary outcome was coronary artery plaque severity categorized as normal, non-obstructive disease, one-vessel disease, two-vessel disease, and three-vessel or left main disease. Among 18 927 adults of genetically inferred European ancestry and 4039 adults of genetically inferred African ancestry, we observed consistent associations between genetically predicted Lp(a) and obstructive coronary plaque, with effect sizes trending upward for increasingly severe categories of disease. Associations were independent of risk factors, clinically measured LDL-C and genetically predicted LDL-C. However, we did not find strong or consistent evidence for an association between genetically predicted Lp(a) and risk for non-obstructive plaque.Genetically predicted Lp(a) is positively associated with coronary plaque severity independent of LDL-C, consistent with Lp(a) promoting atherogenesis. However, the effects of Lp(a) may be greater for progression of plaque to obstructive disease than for the initial development of non-obstructive plaque. A limitation of this study is that Lp(a) was estimated using genetic markers and could not be directly assayed nor could apo(a) isoform size.This study assessed the association between genetic propensity towards higher lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] in the blood and the severity of coronary artery plaque seen on clinical angiograms, independent of other factors, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The study was conducted in a large US population using data from the Million Veteran Program. Genetically predicted high Lp(a) was associated with obstructive coronary plaque, but it was not associated with non-obstructive coronary plaque. This association was independent of LDL-C, and the association was greater for more severe forms of disease.The mechanisms of association between Lp(a) and cardiovascular events are debated. Prior studies have shown that Lp(a) does not associate with early markers of atherosclerosis. Our analyses support the idea that Lp(a) plays less of a role in early plaque initiation, but plays a significant role in the progression of plaque towards more severe disease, independent of LDL-C.},

	abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is one of the most common, complex, heterogeneous diseases in the world, with over 1-3\% of the global population living with the condition. Progression of HF can be tracked via MRI measures of structural and functional changes to the heart, namely left ventricle (LV), including ejection fraction, mass, end-diastolic volume, and LV end-systolic volume. Moreover, while genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been a useful tool to identify candidate variants involved in HF risk, they lack crucial tissue-specific and mechanistic information which can be gained from incorporating additional data modalities. This study addresses this gap by incorporating transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide association studies (TWAS and PWAS) to gain insights into genetically-regulated changes in gene expression and protein abundance in precursors to HF measured using MRI-derived cardiac measures as well as full-stage all-cause HF. We identified several gene and protein overlaps between LV ejection fraction and end-systolic volume measures. Many of the overlaps identified in MRI-derived measurements through TWAS and PWAS appear to be shared with all-cause HF. We implicate many putative pathways relevant in HF associated with these genes and proteins via gene-set enrichment and protein-protein interaction network approaches. The results of this study (1) highlight the benefit of using multi-omics to better understand genetics and (2) provide novel insights as to how changes in heart structure and function may relate to HF.},

	abstract = {Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been identified as a causal risk factor for multiple forms of cardiovascular disease. Although observational evidence has linked MDD to peripheral artery disease (PAD), causal evidence of this relationship is lacking.

Methods and Results

Inverse variance weighted 2‐sample Mendelian randomization was used to test the association the between genetic liability for MDD and genetic liability for PAD. Genetic liability for MDD was associated with increased genetic liability for PAD (odds ratio [OR], 1.17 [95\% CI, 1.06–1.29]; P=2.6×10−3). Genetic liability for MDD was also associated with increased genetically determined lifetime smoking (β=0.11 [95\% CI, 0.078–0.14]; P=1.2×10−12), decreased alcohol intake (β=−0.078 [95\% CI, −0.15 to 0]; P=0.043), and increased body mass index (β=0.10 [95\% CI, 0.02–0.19]; P=1.8×10−2), which in turn were associated with genetic liability for PAD (smoking: OR, 2.81 [95\% CI, 2.28–3.47], P=9.8×10−22; alcohol: OR, 0.77 [95\% CI, 0.66–0.88]; P=1.8×10−4; body mass index: OR, 1.61 [95\% CI, 1.52–1.7]; P=1.3×10−57). Controlling for lifetime smoking index, alcohol intake, and body mass index with multivariable Mendelian randomization completely attenuated the association between genetic liability for MDD with genetic liability for PAD.

Conclusions

This work provides evidence for a possible causal association between MDD and PAD that is dependent on intermediate risk factors, adding to the growing body of evidence suggesting that effective management and treatment of cardiovascular diseases may require a composite of physical and mental health interventions.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical approach that has become increasingly popular in the field of cardiovascular disease research. It offers a way to infer potentially causal relationships between risk factors and outcomes using observational data, which is particularly important in cases where randomized clinical trials are not feasible or ethical. With the growing availability of large genetic data sets, MR has become a powerful and accessible tool for studying the risk factors for cardiovascular disease.MR uses genetic variation associated with modifiable exposures or risk factors to mitigate biases that affect traditional observational study designs. The approach uses genetic variants that are randomly assigned at conception as proxies for exposure to a risk factor, mimicking a randomized clinical trial. By comparing the outcomes of individuals with different genetic variants, researchers may draw causal inferences about the effects of specific risk factors on cardiovascular disease, provided assumptions are met that address (1) the association between each genetic variant and risk factor and (2) the association of the genetic variants with confounders and (3) that the association between each genetic variant and the outcome only occurs through the risk factor. Like other observational designs, MR has limitations, which include weak instruments that are not strongly associated with the exposure of interest, linkage disequilibrium where genetic instruments influence the outcome via correlated rather than direct effects, overestimated genetic associations, and selection and survival biases. In addition, many genetic databases and MR studies primarily include populations genetically similar to European reference populations; improved diversity of participants in these databases and studies is critically needed.This review provides an overview of MR methodology, including assumptions, strengths, and limitations. Several important applications of MR in cardiovascular disease research are highlighted, including the identification of drug targets, evaluation of potential cardiovascular risk factors, as well as emerging methodology. Overall, while MR alone can never prove a causal relationship beyond reasonable doubt, MR offers a rigorous approach for investigating possible causal relationships in observational data and has the potential to transform our understanding of the etiology and treatment of cardiovascular disease.},

The imputation procedure predicts the probability of being a genuine case compared to a non-case semiparametrically in a dimension reduction fashion. This procedure is flexible, and vastly generalizes the existing methods. We establish the root-n asymptotic normality of the odds ratio parameter estimator. Our method yields stable odds ratio parameter estimation owing to the application of an efficient semiparametric sufficient dimension reduction estimator.

	abstract = {Aims/Hypothesis Individuals with T2D are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications; early identification of individuals can lead to an alteration of the natural history of the disease. Current approaches to risk prediction tailored to individuals with T2D are exemplified by the RECODe algorithms which predict CVD outcomes among individuals with T2D. Recent efforts to improve CVD risk prediction among the general population have included the incorporation of polygenic risk scores (PRS). This paper aims to investigate the utility of the addition of a coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke and heart failure risk score to the current RECODe model for disease stratification.
Methods We derived PRS using summary statistics for ischemic stroke (IS) from the coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure (HF) and tested prediction accuracy in the Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB). A Cox proportional hazards model was used for time-to-event analyses within our cohort, and we compared model discrimination for the RECODe model with and without a PRS using AUC.
Results The RECODe model alone demonstrated an AUC [95\% CI] of 0.67 [0.62-0.72] for ASCVD; the addition of the three PRS to the model demonstrated an AUC [95\% CI] of 0.66 [0.63-0.70]. A z-test to compare the AUCs of the two models did not demonstrate a detectable difference between the two models (p=0.97)
Conclusions/Interpretation In the present study, we demonstrate that although PRS associate with CVD outcomes independent of traditional risk factors among individuals with T2D, the addition of PRS to contemporary clinical risk models does not specifically improve the predictive performance as compared to the baseline model.
Research in ContextEarly identification of individuals with T2D who are at greatest risk of cardiovascular complications can lead to targeted intensive risk-factor modification with the aim of altering the natural history of the disease.Current approaches to risk prediction tailored to individuals with diabetes are exemplified by the RECODe algorithms which predict both individual and composite CVD outcomes among individuals with T2D.We sought to determine if the addition of a polygenic risk score to current clinical risk models improve predictive modeling of adverse cardiovascular events in individuals with type II diabetes.We demonstrate that although PRS associate with CVD outcomes independent of traditional risk factors among individuals with T2D, the addition of PRS to traditional, validated models does not specifically improve the predictive performance as compared to the base model.RECODe demonstrated modest discrimination potential at baseline (AUC = 0.66). As such, the lack of improved risk prediction may reflect the performance of the RECODe equation in our cohort as opposed to lack of PRS utility.Current performance of clinical risk models appears modest. Although PRS doesn’t meaningfully improve performance, there is still substantial opportunity to improve risk prediction.},

	abstract = {Background: Plasma triglycerides (TGs) are causally associated with coronary artery disease and acute pancreatitis. Apolipoprotein A-V (apoA-V, gene APOA5) is a liver-secreted protein that is carried on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and promotes the enzymatic activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), thereby reducing TG levels. Little is known about apoA-V structure-function; naturally occurring human APOA5 variants can provide novel insights. Methods: We used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to determine the secondary structure of human apoA-V in lipid-free and lipid-associated conditions and identified a C-terminal hydrophobic face. Then, we used genomic data in the Penn Medicine Biobank to identify a rare variant, Q252X, predicted to specifically eliminate this region. We interrogated the function of apoA-V Q252X using recombinant protein in vitro and in vivo in apoa5 knockout mice. Results: Human apoA-V Q252X carriers exhibited elevated plasma TG levels consistent with loss of function. Apoa5 knockout mice injected with AAV vectors expressing wildtype and variant APOA5-AAV recapitulated this phenotype. Part of the loss of function is due to reduced mRNA expression. Functionally, recombinant apoA-V Q252X was more readily soluble in aqueous solutions and more exchangeable with lipoproteins than WT apoA-V. Despite lacking the C-terminal hydrophobic region (a putative lipid binding domain) this protein also decreased plasma TG in vivo. Conclusions: Deletion of apoA-V's C-terminus leads to reduced apoA-V bioavailability in vivo and higher TG levels. However, the C-terminus is not required for lipoprotein binding or enhancement of intravascular lipolytic activity. WT apoA-V is highly prone to aggregation, and this property is markedly reduced in recombinant apoA-V lacking the C-terminus.},

	abstract = {Background:

Observational studies identified elevated blood pressure (BP) as a strong risk factor for thoracic aortic dilation, and BP reduction is the primary medical intervention recommended to prevent progression of aortic aneurysms. However, although BP may impact aortic dilation, aortic size may also impact BP. The causal relationship between BP and thoracic aortic size has not been reliably established.

Methods:

Genome-wide association studies summary statistics were obtained for BP and ascending thoracic aortic diameter (AscAoD). Causal effects of BP on AscAoD were estimated using 2-sample Mendelian randomization using a range of pleiotropy-robust methods.

Results:

Genetically predicted increased systolic BP, diastolic BP, and mean arterial pressure all significantly associate with higher AscAoD (systolic BP: β estimate, 0.0041 mm/mm Hg [95\% CI, 0.0008–0.0074]; P=0.02, diastolic BP: β estimate, 0.0272 mm/mm Hg [95\% CI, 0.0224–0.0320]; P{\textless}0.001, and mean arterial pressure: β estimate, 0.0168 mm/mm Hg [95\% CI, 0.0130–0.0206]; P{\textless}0.001). Genetically predicted pulse pressure, meanwhile, had an inverse association with AscAoD (β estimate, −0.0155 mm/mm Hg [95\% CI, −0.0213 to −0.0096]; P{\textless}0.001). Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses showed that genetically predicted increased mean arterial pressure and reduced pulse pressure were independently associated with AscAoD. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization demonstrated that genetically predicted AscAoD was inversely associated with pulse pressure (β estimate, −2.0721 mm Hg/mm [95\% CI, −3.1137 to −1.0306]; P{\textless}0.001) and systolic BP (β estimate, −1.2878 mm Hg/mm [95\% CI, −2.3533 to −0.2224]; P=0.02), while directly associated with diastolic BP (0.8203 mm Hg/mm [95\% CI, 0.2735–1.3672]; P=0.004).

Conclusions:

BP likely contributes causally to ascending thoracic aortic dilation. Increased AscAoD likely contributes to lower systolic BP and pulse pressure, but not diastolic BP, consistent with the hemodynamic consequences of a reduced aortic diameter.},

Among 67 respiratory conditions tested, 11 had significant associations including MUC5B locus (rs35705950) with increased risk of idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis OR 2.83, p = 4.12 × 10−191; CRHR1 (rs61667602) associated with reduced risk of pulmonary fibrosis, OR 0.84, p = 2.26× 10−12. The TYK2 locus (rs11085727) associated with reduced risk for autoimmune conditions, e.g., psoriasis OR 0.88, p = 6.48 x10-23, lupus OR 0.84, p = 3.97 x 10−06. PheWAS stratified by ancestry demonstrated differences in genotype-phenotype associations. LMNA (rs581342) associated with neutropenia OR 1.29 p = 4.1 x 10−13 among Veterans of African and Hispanic ancestry but not European. Overall, we observed a shared genetic architecture between COVID-19 severity and conditions related to underlying risk factors for severe and poor COVID-19 outcomes. Differing associations between genotype-phenotype across ancestries may inform heterogenous outcomes observed with COVID-19. Divergent associations between risk for severe COVID-19 with autoimmune inflammatory conditions both respiratory and non-respiratory highlights the shared pathways and fine balance of immune host response and autoimmunity and caution required when considering treatment targets.},

	abstract = {Heart failure is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, the contribution of common genetic variation to heart failure risk has not been fully elucidated, particularly in comparison to other common cardiometabolic traits. We report a multi-ancestry genome-wide association study meta-analysis of all-cause heart failure including up to 115,150 cases and 1,550,331 controls of diverse genetic ancestry, identifying 47 risk loci. We also perform multivariate genome-wide association studies that integrate heart failure with related cardiac magnetic resonance imaging endophenotypes, identifying 61 risk loci. Gene-prioritization analyses including colocalization and transcriptome-wide association studies identify known and previously unreported candidate cardiomyopathy genes and cellular processes, which we validate in gene-expression profiling of failing and healthy human hearts. Colocalization, gene expression profiling, and Mendelian randomization provide convergent evidence for the roles of BCKDHA and circulating branch-chain amino acids in heart failure and cardiac structure. Finally, proteome-wide Mendelian randomization identifies 9 circulating proteins associated with heart failure or quantitative imaging traits. These analyses highlight similarities and differences among heart failure and associated cardiovascular imaging endophenotypes, implicate common genetic variation in the pathogenesis of heart failure, and identify circulating proteins that may represent cardiomyopathy treatment targets.},

	abstract = {Pharmacologic activation of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism is protective in models of heart failure (HF). How protection occurs remains unclear, although a causative block in cardiac BCAA oxidation is widely assumed. Here, we use in vivo isotope infusions to show that cardiac BCAA oxidation in fact increases, rather than decreases, in HF. Moreover, cardiac-specific activation of BCAA oxidation does not protect from HF even though systemic activation does. Lowering plasma and cardiac BCAAs also fails to confer significant protection, suggesting alternative mechanisms of protection. Surprisingly, activation of BCAA catabolism lowers blood pressure (BP), a known cardioprotective mechanism. BP lowering occurred independently of nitric oxide and reflected vascular resistance to adrenergic constriction. Mendelian randomization studies revealed that elevated plasma BCAAs portend higher BP in humans. Together, these data indicate that BCAA oxidation lowers vascular resistance, perhaps in part explaining cardioprotection in HF that is not mediated directly in cardiomyocytes.},

We document near equivalent heritability of CAD across multiple ancestral groups, identify 95 novel loci, including nine on the X chromosome, detect eight loci of genome-wide significance in Black and Hispanic individuals, and demonstrate that two common haplotypes at the 9p21 locus are responsible for risk stratification in all populations except those of African origin, in which these haplotypes are virtually absent. Moreover, in the largest GWAS for angiographically derived coronary atherosclerosis performed to date, we find 15 loci of genome-wide significance that robustly overlap with established loci for clinical CAD. Phenome-wide association analyses of novel loci and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) augment signals related to insulin resistance, extend pleiotropic associations of these loci to include smoking and family history, and precisely document the markedly reduced transferability of existing PRSs to Black individuals. Downstream integrative analyses reinforce the critical roles of vascular endothelial, fibroblast, and smooth muscle cells in CAD susceptibility, but also point to a shared biology between atherosclerosis and oncogenesis. This study highlights the value of diverse populations in further characterizing the genetic architecture of CAD.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pmed.1003288},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies have identified height as a strong risk factor for atrial fibrillation, but this finding may be limited by residual confounding. We aimed to examine genetic variation in height within the Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to determine whether height has a causal effect on risk of atrial fibrillation.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In summary-level analyses, MR was performed using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of height (GIANT/UK Biobank; 693,529 individuals) and atrial fibrillation (AFGen; 65,446 cases and 522,744 controls), finding that each 1-SD increase in genetically predicted height increased the odds of atrial fibrillation (odds ratio [OR] 1.34; 95\% CI 1.29 to 1.40; p = 5 × 10-42). This result remained consistent in sensitivity analyses with MR methods that make different assumptions about the presence of pleiotropy, and when accounting for the effects of traditional cardiovascular risk factors on atrial fibrillation. Individual-level phenome-wide association studies of height and a height genetic risk score were performed among 6,567 European-ancestry participants of the Penn Medicine Biobank (median age at enrollment 63 years, interquartile range 55-72; 38\% female; recruitment 2008-2015), confirming prior observational associations between height and atrial fibrillation. Individual-level MR confirmed that each 1-SD increase in height increased the odds of atrial fibrillation, including adjustment for clinical and echocardiographic confounders (OR 1.89; 95\% CI 1.50 to 2.40; p = 0.007). The main limitations of this study include potential bias from pleiotropic effects of genetic variants, and lack of generalizability of individual-level findings to non-European populations.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed evidence that height is likely a positive causal risk factor for atrial fibrillation. Further study is needed to determine whether risk prediction tools including height or anthropometric risk factors can be used to improve screening and primary prevention of atrial fibrillation, and whether biological pathways involved in height may offer new targets for treatment of atrial fibrillation.},

	abstract = {Importance: Smoking is associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but the relative contribution to each subtype (coronary artery disease [CAD], peripheral artery disease [PAD], and large-artery stroke) remains less well understood.
Objective: To determine the association between genetic liability to smoking and risk of CAD, PAD, and large-artery stroke.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Mendelian randomization study using summary statistics from genome-wide associations of smoking (UK Biobank; up to 462 690 individuals), CAD (Coronary Artery Disease Genome Wide Replication and Meta-analysis plus the Coronary Artery Disease Genetics Consortium; up to 60 801 cases, 123 504 controls), PAD (VA Million Veteran Program; up to 24 009 cases, 150 983 controls), and large-artery stroke (MEGASTROKE; up to 4373 cases, 406 111 controls). This study was conducted using summary statistic data from large, previously described cohorts. Review of those publications does not reveal the total recruitment dates for those cohorts. Data analyses were conducted from August 2019 to June 2020.
Exposures: Genetic liability to smoking (as proxied by genetic variants associated with lifetime smoking index).
Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk (odds ratios [ORs]) of CAD, PAD, and large-artery stroke.
Results: Genetic liability to smoking was associated with increased risk of PAD (OR, 2.13; 95\% CI, 1.78-2.56; P = 3.6 × 10-16), CAD (OR, 1.48; 95\% CI, 1.25-1.75; P = 4.4 × 10-6), and stroke (OR, 1.40; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.92; P = .04). Genetic liability to smoking was associated with greater risk of PAD than risk of large-artery stroke (ratio of ORs, 1.52; 95\% CI, 1.05-2.19; P = .02) or CAD (ratio of ORs, 1.44; 95\% CI, 1.12-1.84; P = .004). The association between genetic liability to smoking and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases remained independent from the effects of smoking on traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this mendelian randomization analysis of data from large studies of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, genetic liability to smoking was a strong risk factor for CAD, PAD, and stroke, although the estimated association was strongest between smoking and PAD. The association between smoking and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.},

	abstract = {Keywords: acute coronary syndrome • myocardial injury • percutaneous coronary intervention • SARS-CoV-2 • sepsis-related cardiomyopathy • ST-elevation myocardial infarction • stress-induced cardiomyopathy • thromboem-bolism Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in December 2019, yet within months it had spread to pandemic levels with critical global health implications to the clinical practice of all specialties. In cardiology, COVID-19 has imposed an unfortunate conundrum: the disease is significantly associated with death in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, [1,2] and yet hospital admissions and certain cardiac procedures have significantly declined compared with prior years [3-5]. This creates a potentially multiplicative problem if COVID-19 and its etiologic virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), directly or indirectly cause increased cardiac damage while patients with cardiac disease are simultaneously undertreated for pre-existing or de novo illness. Here, we assess how COVID-19 may have influenced this apparent decline in cardiac care. We also consider how clinicians can optimize the diagnostic process to provide appropriate and timely patient care in the setting of increased uncertainty regarding the etiology of acute cardiovascular disease. This process is dynamic and will necessitate adaptive strategies over time, particularly as many hospitals, states and countries transition slowly toward the re-escalation of standard operations while being mindful of COVID-19 resurgence. In spite of numerous mechanisms that may increase the likelihood or severity of cardiovascular disease in COVID-19, many centers have thus far reported a decline in the number of patients admitted for the acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A recent report from the British Heart Foundation revealed that the patient footfall seeking medical attention for myocardial infarction, which is defined as myocardial cell death due to prolonged ischemia, was essentially halved in March 2020, compared with the same period a year ago in England [6]. This worrying trend is similarly observed in other countries severely affected by COVID-19, including the USA [5] and Spain; [7] the latter saw, among its 81 centers, the numbers of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (48\% decrease), cardiac structural interventions (81\% decrease) and diagnostic procedures (56\% decrease) dropped, significantly. Several societal, health system and infection-control issues have likely contributed to the decreased frequency of timely cardiac diagnoses during this pandemic. The morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 understandably begets fear and concerns in the general population. Coupled with government public health policies recommending patients to avoid the hospital unless suffering from severe COVID-19 symptoms or medical emergencies, rates of hospitalization have overall decreased. While a bona fide reduction in the incidence of ACS in the general population due to the imposed Future Cardiol.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an important cause of cardiovascular mortality; however, its genetic determinants remain incompletely defined. In total, 10 previously identified risk loci explain a small fraction of AAA heritability.
METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study in the Million Veteran Program testing ≈18 million DNA sequence variants with AAA (7642 cases and 172 172 controls) in veterans of European ancestry with independent replication in up to 4972 cases and 99 858 controls. We then used mendelian randomization to examine the causal effects of blood pressure on AAA. We examined the association of AAA risk variants with aneurysms in the lower extremity, cerebral, and iliac arterial beds, and derived a genome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) to identify a subset of the population at greater risk for disease.
RESULTS: Through a genome-wide association study, we identified 14 novel loci, bringing the total number of known significant AAA loci to 24. In our mendelian randomization analysis, we demonstrate that a genetic increase of 10 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.43 [95\% CI, 1.24-1.66]; P=1.6×10-6), as opposed to systolic blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.06 [95\% CI, 0.97-1.15]; P=0.2), likely has a causal relationship with AAA development. We observed that 19 of 24 AAA risk variants associate with aneurysms in at least 1 other vascular territory. A 29-variant PRS was strongly associated with AAA (odds ratioPRS, 1.26 [95\% CI, 1.18-1.36]; PPRS=2.7×10-11 per SD increase in PRS), independent of family history and smoking risk factors (odds ratioPRS+family history+smoking, 1.24 [95\% CI, 1.14-1.35]; PPRS=1.27×10-6). Using this PRS, we identified a subset of the population with AAA prevalence greater than that observed in screening trials informing current guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: We identify novel AAA genetic associations with therapeutic implications and identify a subset of the population at significantly increased genetic risk of AAA independent of family history. Our data suggest that extending current screening guidelines to include testing to identify those with high polygenic AAA risk, once the cost of genotyping becomes comparable with that of screening ultrasound, would significantly increase the yield of current screening at reasonable cost.},

	abstract = {Clinical observations have linked tobacco smoking with increased type 2 diabetes risk. Mendelian randomization analysis has recently suggested smoking may be a causal risk factor for type 2 diabetes. However, this association could be mediated by additional risk factors correlated with smoking behavior, which have not been investigated. We hypothesized that body mass index (BMI) could help to explain the association between smoking and diabetes risk. First, we confirmed that genetic determinants of smoking initiation increased risk for type 2 diabetes (OR 1.21, 95\% CI: 1.15–1.27, P = 1 × 10−12) and coronary artery disease (CAD; OR 1.21, 95\% CI: 1.16–1.26, P = 2 × 10−20). Additionally, 2-fold increased smoking risk was positively associated with increased BMI ({\textasciitilde}0.8 kg/m2, 95\% CI: 0.54–0.98 kg/m2, P = 1.8 × 10−11). Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses showed that BMI accounted for nearly all the risk smoking exerted on type 2 diabetes (OR 1.06, 95\% CI: 1.01–1.11, P = 0.03). In contrast, the independent effect of smoking on increased CAD risk persisted (OR 1.12, 95\% CI: 1.08–1.17, P = 3 × 10−8). Causal mediation analyses agreed with these estimates. Furthermore, analysis using individual-level data from the Million Veteran Program independently replicated the association of smoking behavior with CAD (OR 1.24, 95\% CI: 1.12–1.37, P = 2 × 10−5), but not type 2 diabetes (OR 0.98, 95\% CI: 0.89–1.08, P = 0.69), after controlling for BMI. Our findings support a model whereby genetic determinants of smoking increase type 2 diabetes risk indirectly through their relationship with obesity. Smokers should be advised to stop smoking to limit type 2 diabetes and CAD risk. Therapeutic efforts should consider pathophysiology relating smoking and obesity.},

	abstract = {Recent genome-wide association studies have identified a genetic locus at human chromosome 8q24 as having minor alleles associated with lower levels of plasma triglyceride (TG) and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), higher levels of HDL-C, as well as decreased risk for myocardial infarction. This locus contains only one annotated gene, tribbles homolog 1 (TRIB1), which has not previously been implicated in lipoprotein metabolism. Here we demonstrate a role for Trib1 as a regulator of lipoprotein metabolism in mice. Hepatic-specific overexpression of Trib1 reduced levels of plasma TG and cholesterol by reducing VLDL production; conversely, Trib1-knockout mice showed elevated levels of plasma TG and cholesterol due to increased VLDL production. Hepatic Trib1 expression was inversely associated with the expression of key lipogenic genes and measures of lipogenesis. Thus, we provide functional evidence for what we believe to be a novel gene regulating hepatic lipogenesis and VLDL production in mice that influences plasma lipids and risk for myocardial infarction in humans.},

	abstract = {Ischemic stroke is a major cause of mortality and long-term disability with limited treatment options, and a greater understanding of the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying ischemic stroke-associated neuroinflammation is required for new therapies. To study ischemic stroke in vivo, mice were subjected to sustained ischemia by intraluminal filament-induced middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) for 24 h without reperfusion or transient ischemia for 30 min followed by 23.5 h reperfusion, and brain miRNA and mRNA expression changes were quantified by TaqMan OpenArrays and gene (mRNA) expression arrays, respectively. Sustained ischemia resulted in 18 significantly altered miRNAs and 392 altered mRNAs in mouse brains compared to Sham controls; however, the transient ischemic condition was found to impact only 6 miRNAs and 126 mRNAs. miR-367-3p was found to be significantly decreased in brain homogenates with sustained ischemia. G protein-coupled receptor, family C, group 5, member A (Gprc5a), a miR-367-3p target gene, was found to be significantly increased with sustained ischemia. In primary neurons, inhibition of endogenous miR-367-3p resulted in a significant increase in Gprc5a expression. Moreover, miR-367-3p was found to be co-expressed with GPRC5A in human neurons. Results suggest that loss of miR-367-3p suppression of GPRC5A may contribute to neuroinflammation associated with ischemic stroke.},

	abstract = {Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) is a circulating inhibitor of lipoprotein and endothelial lipase whose physiological function has remained obscure. Here we show that ANGPTL3 plays a major role in promoting uptake of circulating very low density lipoprotein-triglycerides (VLDL-TGs) into white adipose tissue (WAT) rather than oxidative tissues (skeletal muscle, heart brown adipose tissue) in the fed state. This conclusion emerged from studies of Angptl3-/- mice. Whereas feeding increased VLDL-TG uptake into WAT eightfold in wild-type mice, no increase occurred in fed Angptl3-/- animals. Despite the reduction in delivery to and retention of TG inWAT, fat mass was largely preserved by a compensatory increase in de novo lipogenesis in Angptl3-/- mice. Glucose uptake into WAT was increased 10-fold in KO mice, and tracer studies revealed increased conversion of glucose to fatty acids in WAT but not liver. It is likely that the increased uptake of glucose into WAT explains the increased insulin sensitivity associated with inactivation of ANGPTL3. The beneficial effects of ANGPTL3 deficiency on both glucose and lipoprotein metabolism make it an attractive therapeutic target.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is influenced by genetic variation and traditional risk factors. Polygenic risk scores (PRS), which can be ascertained before the development of traditional risk factors, have been shown to identify individuals at elevated risk of CAD. Here, we demonstrate that a genome-wide PRS for CAD predicts all-cause mortality after accounting for not only traditional cardiovascular risk factors but also angiographic CAD itself. METHODS: Individuals who underwent coronary angiography and were enrolled in an institutional biobank were included; those with prior myocardial infarction or heart transplant were excluded. Using a pruning-and-thresholding approach, a genome-wide PRS comprised of 139 239 variants was calculated for 1503 participants who underwent coronary angiography and genotyping. Individuals were categorized into high PRS (hiPRS) and low-PRS control groups using the maximally selected rank statistic. Stratified analysis based on angiographic findings was also performed. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality following the index coronary angiogram. RESULTS: Individuals with hiPRS were younger than controls (66 years versus 69 years; P=2.1×10-5) but did not differ by sex, body mass index, or traditional risk-factor profiles. Individuals with hiPRS were at significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality after cardiac catheterization, adjusting for traditional risk factors and angiographic extent of CAD (hazard ratio, 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.2-2.2; P=0.004). The strongest increase in risk of all-cause mortality conferred by hiPRS was seen among individuals without angiographic CAD (hazard ratio, 2.4; 95\% CI, 1.1-5.5; P=0.04). In the overall cohort, adding hiPRS to traditional risk assessment improved prediction of 5-year all-cause mortality (area under the receiver-operating curve 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.66-0.75 versus 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.61-0.70; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A genome-wide PRS improves risk stratification when added to traditional risk factors and coronary angiography. Individuals without angiographic CAD but with hiPRS remain at significantly elevated risk of mortality.},

	abstract = {High-density lipoproteins (HDL) have many biological functions, including reducing endothelial activation and adhesion molecule expression. We recently reported that HDL transport and deliver functional microRNAs (miRNA). Here we show that HDL suppresses expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) through the transfer of miR-223 to endothelial cells. After incubation of endothelial cells with HDL, mature miR-223 levels are significantly increased in endothelial cells and decreased on HDL. However, miR-223 is not transcribed in endothelial cells and is not increased in cells treated with HDL from miR-223 -/- mice. HDL inhibit ICAM-1 protein levels, but not in cells pretreated with miR-223 inhibitors. ICAM-1 is a direct target of HDL-transferred miR-223 and this is the first example of an extracellular miRNA regulating gene expression in cells where it is not transcribed. Collectively, we demonstrate that HDL's anti-inflammatory properties are conferred, in part, through HDL-miR-223 delivery and translational repression of ICAM-1 in endothelial cells. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

The clinical associations of carrying the variant, its effect in other African ancestry populations including Hispanic/Latino individuals, and the rates of achieving a clinical diagnosis in carriers are unknown.
Objective: To assess the association between the TTR V122I variant and heart failure and identify rates of hATTR-CM diagnosis among carriers with heart failure.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional analysis of carriers and noncarriers of TTR V122I of African ancestry aged 50 years or older enrolled in the Penn Medicine Biobank between 2008 and 2017 using electronic health record data from 1996 to 2017. Case-control study in participants of African and Hispanic/Latino ancestry with and without heart failure in the Mount Sinai BioMe Biobank enrolled between 2007 and 2015 using electronic health record data from 2007 to 2018.
Exposures: TTR V122I carrier status.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was prevalent heart failure. The rate of diagnosis with hATTR-CM among TTR V122I carriers with heart failure was measured.
Results: The cross-sectional cohort included 3724 individuals of African ancestry with a median age of 64 years (interquartile range, 57-71); 1755 (47\%) were male, 2896 (78\%) had a diagnosis of hypertension, and 753 (20\%) had a history of myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization. There were 116 TTR V122I carriers (3.1\%); 1121 participants (30\%) had heart failure. The case-control study consisted of 2307 individuals of African ancestry and 3663 Hispanic/Latino individuals; the median age was 73 years (interquartile range, 68-80), 2271 (38\%) were male, 4709 (79\%) had a diagnosis of hypertension, and 1008 (17\%) had a history of myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization. There were 1376 cases of heart failure. TTR V122I was associated with higher rates of heart failure (cross-sectional cohort: n = 51/116 TTR V122I carriers [44\%], n = 1070/3608 noncarriers [30\%], adjusted odds ratio, 1.7 [95\% CI, 1.2-2.4], P = .006; case-control study: n = 36/1376 heart failure cases [2.6\%], n = 82/4594 controls [1.8\%], adjusted odds ratio, 1.8 [95\% CI, 1.2-2.7], P = .008). Ten of 92 TTR V122I carriers with heart failure (11\%) were diagnosed as having hATTR-CM; the median time from onset of symptoms to clinical diagnosis was 3 years.
Conclusions and Relevance: Among individuals of African or Hispanic/Latino ancestry enrolled in 2 academic medical center-based biobanks, the TTR V122I genetic variant was significantly associated with heart failure.},
